Strength in Diversity

The scope of this societal treatise is complete; all major components of society are unified unto a single virtue: Individuality.
✦
No known government in history has evolved towards health. 
History proves civilizations decay due faults rooted in the inability of structure - to resolve predictable human behavior.

Fault of the Individual: 
	{ pride, envy, wrath, sloth, greed, gluttony, lust }

Fault of the Organization:
	{ type-hate, cartel, censor, monopoly, treason, pacification, territorial }

This set of universal-faults is kept central to the design of this society.
Structures are established to repel the set of faults with counter-virtues.
✦
A theory may be practically-flawed yet may evolve into success by wise-implementation.
A theoretically-flawed construct has no hope of success.

First: mankind must develop a complete theory of society which considers all its departments. No part in contradiction to the whole's foundational logic.

Then: this theory must be distilled over time by speculative implementation, to round cohesive evolution.

Finally: the structure will be ready for the commitment of a bold nation. Revolution begun with a clear understanding of successful steps towards reformation.
✦
A nation is most vulnerable after a revolution: 
	prior nation exhausted to a break-point ➡︎ 
	followed by prolonged revolutionary war ➡︎ 
	international debt & collateral ➡︎ 
	compromises enable a international-backed tyrant

Compromises are essential. 
Yet a compromises often contradict the Constitution of a nation.
If any basis thread is severed by compromise, then the woven constitution frays over time, and under stress breaches the integrity of the whole.

Neither government nor revolutionary has resources in a revolution,
Debt-acquisition always gives the upper hand to a foreign power. 

If a foreign nation aided either side, the victor has the obligation to, in time, punish the foreign nation.
Nations have the obligation to aid a nation-under-revolution FROM receiving external help. 
✦
Once a Constitution fails, no nation afterwards resumes integrity.
Corruption, damned since installment of integrity, floods and permeates all layers of society - with all the wiles of a starved predator wise enough to secure territory foremost.
✦
Theory & trial of a new Constitution must precede revolution.
Thereby ensuring compromises never undermine the foundation.
✦
A Republic is a corrupted form of Aristocracy.

America revolted without a clear & simple structure to adhere to in the tumult of the transmutation.
America built a federal republic, which was in contradiction against the intent of revolutionaries seeking Individual liberty.

A republic is the rule of the mass by the few powerful.

The single distinction of a republic from aristocracy: hereditary domain can never be official. 
This generalization, from official lineage into non-official & non-public dominion, allowed power to become available to any person - free of oversight. 

Republics are rife with treason.
Citizens empowered by fortune and immigrants backed by foreign powers.

Aristocracy bound power to native family lines. 
This official tract served as an essential pillar of the people to check powers of the deciding body.
✦
Democracy has never been implemented.
Plain logic disproves the Democracy in small scale.

Aristocracy will long-suffer because it has the scope of secure future.
Masses, who have no secure future, will always choose the path which returns best in the moment - regardless of the longterm effects.

Divine Lineage is the only government proven to be sustainable for centuries.
✦
Deep state corruption, being past redemption, dies in slow romanic-erosion hidden by illusions of the extorters.

IWO is bound united as glass: it will hold true or shatter in plain view to the public. 
The entire framework is simple and can be taught to every citizen.
Cyclic Constitutions allow IWO to conform to the current generation, being freed from perpetual laws, and allows legal & peaceful revolutions. 

This work does not pretend perfection; it facilitates sane evolution. 
The Opensource nature invites any to improve & offer suggestions. 
The purpose is to build an implementable system well-honed for a nation in revolution to achieve a logical society.

Definitions
Organizations converge to one group gaining total monopoly. 
The lifecycle of organization: control the government to cater lifestyle, oppress the masses for gain, lastly internal-self-consumption.

Ideals are defined as ideas which are never attained. Each action, by common sense perception, either approaches or distances from the Ideal.

Ideals are critical in offering humanity invariant hope, each faithful step rewards a more perfect state of being in regard to the idea.

Each generation has its own evolved definition of the Ideal.

Convergence is the definite & provable approach towards an Ideal.

Divergence is any action which trends away from an Ideal.

Integration of all information (each a standardized element) from independent methods - compiles an image of each generation.

Each generation is compared against the compiled history.
Image of each generation is projected - under convolution with the set of all generations.
Shape of each generation clearly accounted against historic states to depict an honest state of existence.

Decentralization is the independence of source & implementation - from any central control. 
Communities of Individual entities operate critical infrastructure for communication.
Community militia operate independent from federal command.
Jury of volunteers vote in courts, where all are able to voice a statement.

Individual is the single discrete societal entity. 

Organization is a structured group of individuals which submit to the will of the leader.
	{ government, corporation, religion, sect, extended-family }

Axioms of Rights
Axioms of the basic rights of existence.
This is a minimal set which alone form the immutable kernel of all society, in every age.  
These Axioms are based upon the American Bill of Rights. 


Life: right of all life as given by birth. Exist no right of dependence. Execution as jury judgement. Ideal: all life is sacred. Anti: existence as resource.
Liberty: right of choice, but not freedom from consequence. No slavery. No arrest without jury warrant. No jails: immediate punishment or exile. Arrest only to the extent of obtaining identity & proof of criminal action. Exist no conscription.
Speech: right of speech. Action must be entirely confined to speech: leading a mob is not speech, organizing is not speech, proven-threat is not speech. Printed content is protected by speech. Threat without means of fulfillment is speech. Pulpit in commons is protected by speech if it only calls for individual contemplation.
Arms: right to arm. If government can equip a specific arm, then Individual can likewise equip the arm.
Oath: right to hold office accountable. Institutionalized: breach of axioms, treason against nation, betrayal against countryman. Purge - if proven valid - glorifies the Individual.
Freedom: right of movement. Easement of identified Individuals and animals across all space that is not residence-home. This does not protect loitering.
Domain: right of domain of the Individual. Domain of the Individual: family members, residence, land, business assets & profits.
Privacy: right to private communications. Non-private communication: govt, organizational & business. No spy, entrapment, nor seizure of information. 
Belief: right of personal belief. Family-only worship on residential-land. Illegal to worship in organization or extended-family. 
God: right of divine lineage. Single head of nation and lineage of succession. Lineage of the Individual bound in survival to The Divine House.Individual
Individual is the only entity in society; the unit of measure in a homogenous historical framework.

Individual is the entity of the adult - responsible for self. 
Individual is the entity of the household - responsible for dependents.
Individual is the entity of the God - responsible for nation.

As Individual exists over self, is as Individual over household, is as Individual over nation.
Responsibility & accountability is only scaled, but never warped to be inconsistent in a generalized situation.
✦
The Individual unit compiles a nation into an exhaustive & explicit map of the society at any point in time to produce direct measurements.
Homogenity of the Individual unit allows clear & robust comparison of current records to historic states - all based upon the same unit.
✦
Individual unit is exposed due to its isolated nature. 
Societal hierarchy is explicit.
Exist no organization able to mask privilege.
✦
Individual is defined as an accountable adult entity:
	{ man, woman, head(husband-wife), head(husband-wife-children-elderly), owner(employee), master(apprentice), commander(militia), judge(jury), king(nation) }

Individuals are the sole holders of power: 
	{ economic, militia, legislative, judicial, social, civic, academic }
✦
Life requires time & space in which to exist.

Ancestral home is the domain of the Individual:
	to enshrine family lineage over time.
	to pass forward inheritance of generationally-improved space immune from loss.
✦
Head of household is an official position of family governance.
Line of succession is public information.

Community may force choice of heir to court, under claims of clan establishment.
DNA is public researchable data used to curb clan establishments by wedlock or adoption. 

Adoption never supplants the official bloodline.
Lineage immutably tied to the original family. 
If an adopted-heir attains head-of-family, the next heir must be from the original family line. 
If no man nor woman of original blood-line is found, then the family line perishes and the ancestral parcel is forsaken.

Extinguished bloodlines condemn the ancestral-land to wild-lands.
✦
Every 6 months the Head of household is required to vacate the region.
Family stays at home to vote to reaffirm or replace the Head.

This resolution is officially submitted to the community.
Upon return the Head must accept the family choice or face expulsion enforced by the community.

Mismanagement or abuse is checked by family decision.
Family suffers the failures of the Head, and thus has a right in choice of governance.
✦
Individual centric society converges to independence, responsibility and honor.
Individual societies cultivate competition in diversity; well-adapted to season and region.
✦
In ungoverned wilds, balance & harmony exist naturally.

Organization of mankind establishes constructs which contradict & deny principles inherited by all forms of life.

First, society must return to the simplicity of the irreducible entity, the Individual.
Atop this primordial, universal foundation - society can build intelligent progression.
✦
No man is an island.
The Individual always in a state of chemistry with the environment.
The human soul always in instantaneous convolution:
	{ health, mental, emotional, family, society, power }

Change to the environment into a new state of being - changes behavior unpredictably.
 
Society is an endeavor of harmony between structure & instability.
⌬
God is scaled from the living Individual. God only exists within living men. 

Jury is the aggregate of Individuals immutably identified to decidings of Justice.

Militia is the aggregate of Individuals bearing arms in defense of Invasion.

Land is the domain of the Individual transcended to a lifetime of a Nation.

AI is the logic of dedicated Individuals oathsworn in global Consensus. 

ORP is the external representation of generational Memory.

Man-meat is the Individual's life debt ecological Balance.

Global Initiative is the Axioms of Rights extended to all Humanity.

God
God is the crowned head of the nation.

As the Individual holds domain over self, by inheritance.
As the Individual holds domain over household, by inheritance.
As the Individual holds domain over business, by inheritance.
As the Individual holds domain over nation, by inheritance.

Public Office of God is only - the scaling of domain.
If an action is consistent with the self, with the household, with the business - then that action is consistent of God unto nation.
✦
Society establishes the laws which govern the nation, isolated from the influence of the Divine Family.
God administers, but does not create the law.

Citizen Marshalls, being Individuals highly scrutinized, are self-appointed checks upon the administration of God. Where God is not able to act, the Citizen Marshalls acts, each independent. 
✦
God builds society to health; the nation is the secure inheritance to Divine Lineage.
Society commits to honor The Divine Lineage in all respects, or enact a complete purge of the Divine Lineage.

Marriage until death of the entire nation; do a Divine Lineage & Nation part.
All ownership titles are nullified, and the nation must be rebuilt entirely.
✦
Society establishes laws which are checked into balance by God.

God issues divine veto, the ZENG-ZI, by direct messengers.
Posting the express will of God, which are not enactable under current law.

ZENG-ZI is written upon unique red-paper & unique black ink. 
Identifiable to each God. 

ZENG-ZI remains at the designated community post for three months.

Veto is then voted on:
	7:10 is a full & immediate instatement of the will of God.
	4:10 is a compromise weighing in favor of God relative to the ratio.

Compromise must reach 7:10 ratio of agreement.
It is written on unique black-paper & unique red-ink.
Identifiable to each community.

ZENG-ZI & Compromises are proof of an unstable social state.
They are stored as a pair in the community Divine Temple.

ZENG-ZI is proof of disharmony between the will of the nation and its God.
Compromises are proof of disrespect of God as the head of the nation.

This interaction is mar upon the nation in history, and to the world.

Disharmony breeds dishonor which extends from head of nation, to militia, to business, to household.

International reputation suffers in these exchanges.
✦
Society, as the household to the head, has the right to cage the administration of God to the extreme triviality as a mere figurehead, or appoint an administrator in the God's stead.

Temperament of God effects how society creates laws.

Historic & international honor checks how the nation respects God.
Low respect of God hurts international business, and the respect of its families.
✦
Harmonious & involved Gods: will shape the nation by administration of laws reflective of the current society.

Disharmonious & involved Gods: will contend with the current society, throttled by 3 month duration per ZENG-ZI. 

Harmonious or disharmonious & uninvolved Gods: Individuals under Oath will administer the nation.
✦
Administration of the law has a major effect on the character of the actual implementation.
Therein lies the power of God to shape the nation.

Exist immediate constraints upon God to relinquish administration.  
Such action is a public drastic disgrace to the entire nation.
✦
God has the liberty to choose how divine influence will affect the nation.

God has the right to choose any office in administration.
Involvement in the highest capacity, elevated by Divinity.

God disharmonious in one position and being zoned out, may find harmony in another area of administration. 

God retains the right to failure.
The Divine House
God sets the order of inheritance position by explicit listing.

ZENG-ZI sets the globally known succession of Divine Lineage by red-ink upon gold-paper.
Rejection by 8:10 is posted by each community by gold-ink upon black-paper.

The nation will not be burdened by the will of a deceased God.
✦
At all times the line of succession is publicly known.

Each position gains the approval of the nation by public ordeal.
Each Individual is scrutinized their entire life. 

Disharmonious Divinity can only exist due two root causes:
	Individual failure in consistency.
	incorrect assessment by the nation.

The nation is able to learn how to better assess succession when mistakes are made.

Distant relatives and adoption follow the same rules as a household. 

DNA bloodline, being publicly known, will converge the original bloodline back into power.
✦
Central objective of the Divine House: cultivate & foster virtue of stability.
Set the standard-form for the nation to adopt.

Divine House is a stately organization, being composed by God and confirmed by the nation.
The House represents the nation at the world stage.

Each nation is represented by their respective Divine House. 
Standards & customs are distilled into sharp cultures of diversity.
✦
Chinese establish harems to allow extreme diversity of the bloodline across the nation.
Many families attain access to Diving Lineage by wedlock.

Europeans keep small family cores. Focus upon simplicity which avoids a constant battle for positions, at the cost of volatile bloodlines.

Africans favor warrior females, with an emphasis on adoption, to nurture strength as a true meritocracy. 

Tribal kingdoms set each citizen as family which appoints God from the oldest & wisest.
One Ring Platform [ORP]
ORP is the information hub of the society from local to global.
The platform hosts decentralized, synchronized, immutable data.

Humanities greatest strength is collective reasoning. 
Unaltered history gives the future freedom to learn from the past.

Information flows freely & symmetrical.
Equality of information-access is established between citizen and official.
If one has public data, then all have access to the public data.
✦
Every adult individual is required to be processed onto ORP.
Freedom of movement is enabled by public information of identity & position.

Identity is verified by biometrics; exist no fake accounts.
This establishes community safety which is endangered by Liberty.

Authenticity of action on ORP is robust by stranger-witnesses.
These allow any individual to confirm identity in person and then posting the result.
✦
Immutable data favors honesty. 
Lies are permanent marks.
Public history of the Individual is public information.

Individuals may post on their own profile.
Society may comment unrestricted onto profiles of others.
✦
Official lines of information flow:
Household -> Community -> County -> State -> Region -> Nation -> Continent -> Globe -> Extraterrestrial.

Stored data is the medium of the security of society. 
All data is Opensource and freely transferrable.
Any one is able to maintain a decentralized node to contribute to the platform: 
	{ historic, current, archived, online, unique-focus, broad swathe }

Stable information is archived in compressed forms.

Data can be accessed online, from offline archives, from foreign confirmations.
✦
Main information exists on 8 server nodes:
	{ DNA, Vote, Jury, Citizenry, Militia, Business, Social, Legislation }

One of each type of server node connects to a Reconciliation node, whose job it is to synchronize versions with other Reconciliation nodes.
✦
Current updating information is cached data, being less stable but concurrent, stored in high-traffic registers.
Archived data, stabilized by time & independence of region, stored online or offline.
✦
Reconciliation nodes are the primary gate of security, being maintained by reputation of the Individual.
Reconciliation nodes communicate amongst themselves to reach agreement of data content.

Once the update of data is stable, it is pushed onto the respective octagon-node-set.

Main updates throughout the network-backbone are done by secure notarized nodes.
Instability of data only exists between communication amongst Reconciliation nodes.
Only after stability of updates, do the nodes of the Octagon receive information.
✦
Primary backbone of the network is not the only path.

Exist many interconnected peer-to-peer connections which operate in non-standard ways.

Yet all forms of information flow must agree with the resolutions of reconciliation nodes: 
	{ independent flows, offline drive transfers, global positioning }

Irregularities are addressed and fixed only in the peer-to-peer Reconciliation tier. 
✦
Faces of the octagon are independent in synchronization.
Failure to reach agreement of update - will stall updates to all nodes of that family.
Other faces will proceed normally.

Data versioning & synchronization are the vital algorithms of the entire IWO infrastructure.
Generations will hone these procedures into stable evolution.
✦
Many sectors of IWO rely directly upon ORP.
Powerful facets of society have a critical interest in maintaining & upgrading the network.

Strong sectors build powerful nodes which benefit the entire network.
Individual enthusiasts supplement the network authenticity with an independent isolation of power.
✦
Access keys are all one-time usage.
Access is a resource that allows node administrators to gain profit from establishing a good reputation.

Identification
Biometric confirmation of Individual user by sensors.
	{ face, voice, thumbprint, ...}

Current public location is archived public information.

Sensors exist in all public spaces and many other spaces for the sake of security.
Movement of Individual is always identified, or proven to be circumventing lawful freedom.

Witness
Witness is an independent verification between two individuals, peer to peer.

This is the greatest check upon society. 
	{ news, witness, origination, perspective, testimony, merit }

10 Year Cycle
Harmonious & stable systems are cyclic.
✦
Axioms are the invariant virtues of the society.

All other laws are cyclic in a 10-Year period.
Society has an appointed time period to create a law system, being new or derivative of the past.

Cyclic Constitutions allow the laws and government to be adapted to each generation.
This serves as a time to recenter & recalibrate.
Then to stabilize for 10-Years, the laws only being subject to ZENG-ZI veto.

During this period of stable laws, the Individual may build a composition to propose for the next cycle.
✦
Historic compositions of laws are available along with the raw data of effects.

Conservative or radical, this is the liberty of choice for each period.
All information is recorded immutable to pass forward victory & failure equally.
✦
Stages of the 10 Year Cycle: 
	{ choice-assessment, vote, ratification, implementation }

Proposals are created & polled during the previous cycle. 
This favors long-lived popularity of a proposal to prove itself over long-term survival at top. 
This is the stage where the proposal adapts to compromise.

The 10-Year Festival is a time for commitment not discussion.

The 10-Year Festival starts with an immediate vote of all proposals.
Voting assessment is stabilized, and then ratified before the end of the Festival.

Implementation is begun on the first day of the 10-Year period.
✦
Ninth year of the 10-year period:
	ZENG-ZI does not operate.
	Year of preparation & research, not to make changes in laws.
	DNA census conducted by international verifications of identity.
	ORP Witness protocols.
	Festivals to celebrate Individualism across the nation facilitate Witness.

Proposals & influencers are listed at the start of the year.
✦
Eleventh Month Eve of the Ninth Year, all strong influencers are banned from social practice & communication.

Confinement upon estate lands, guarded by militia: 
	{ God, Divine House, top government officials, ORP voted, AI chosen }

Confinement or foreign vacation:
	{ creators of proposals, ORP voted, AI chosen }

Selection is proof of prestige. 
This invariant isolation is expected and long-prepared.
The cost of peaceful vote & implementation.
✦
Second month of the First year in the 10-Year cycle - releases the lockdown of influencers.

No confined Individual is allowed back into society until public ratification of the 10-Year Constitution. 
Failure to accept the new Constitution results in banishment.

The Divine Family & Influencers may parade across the nation.
Festival for society to give gifts of thanks for the time sacrificed in isolation.

God creates a calligraphic ZENG-ZI of the new Constitution for each region of the nation.
This is required and serves as ratified commitment to adhere to the laws set.
✦
Assessment of Individual comprehension of the new Constitution is required before access to ORP is restored.






Citizenry Resident Community Rural
Citizens are adults with roles within a community & in the nation.
Residents are non-citizens with no stable roots, immigrants, or under punitive exclusion. 
All adults have speech, but only citizens are able to vote in law & jury.

Citizens & residents are responsible for government & community well-being.
Exist no taxes.
The effort to maintain society is the burden of all who live there.
✦
Easement is the right to pass through, but not to loiter nor settle.
Residence requires approval from the community. 

Community is not isolated from the world. 
Globe pressures nation. Nation pressures side. Side pressures region. Region pressures community.
✦
People have proven to produce efficient transmissions of public actions. 
Observer posts video onto a platform. 
Society determines weight of action
Community laws measures the contribution.

Correct reaction trumps rapid response. 

Individuals are known and the proper action will be taken, correctness > quickness. 
Liberty to act criminally or constructively.
To be judged and then - hunted for sport or respected as a contributor.

'Let each citizen stand, not as a tenant in a corporate state, 
but as a steward of a living community. 
Every hand builds & every public dispute weighed by peers
There justice need not a throne' -- ORAC SCIT
✦
A failed-state needs to be uprooted as resultant of ill foundation & improper growth.

✦
Town structure of zones expanding out.
Core community residences, Town Hall, Stadium & gathering-park.
Major business headquarters
Larger social buildings: grocery, school, hospital, well-fare

Mentor, current & third choice apprentice are available in the same area.
Service to the community grants their house until matrimonial death.
Residences will be built for comfortable respect & live-in-stations for emergency work.
Residence is tied to the role of service.

2) Business can only exist within a stable society, thus community supersedes employment obligation.
How well one contributes to the community trumps excellence in business. 
Businesses locally operate under jurisdiction the community.

4) Families work their way up in the community. From temporary probation, residency non-citizen, stable citizen housing, to long-standing family reputation.

If an individual becomes lethargic, family members must step up to fulfill community service to retain status.
Long-standing families with continued service attain the highest degree of stability, their choice to stay or upgrade to a more dignified residence. 

Movement to towns with culture suited to the temperament of the family is normal. 
Reputation is always carried forward. This allows a way to ease community friction.

Community assigns the distribution of residences in a public & open-source fashion. 
Adherence to strict standard protocols is the iron clad law in distributions.

Stable generational homes for long-standing citizens. 
Neighborhoods of homes for long-term citizens of reputation.
Neighborhoods of homes for non-citizens, both stable & transient.

Daily life, a sudden social emergency, aid, then get counted for service.

Awesome Intelligence will allow voluntary oversight to accurately establish standardized metrics, and verifications - to acts of civic duty.

Witness of unaffiliated citizens will weigh the effectiveness of contributions.

Calculation of contributions is of the same nature of the calculations of Employment.
Community formulas are worked daily. All formulas are public globally. 
Imbalances will emerge blatantly and victims easily decry local favoritism.
✦
Stadium Assembly may be called by any member of the Community Core. 

Town Hall bell will ring, marching band as able, drive-by heralds. 
Allow an hour for attendance. 

Video recordings of the podium, field, stadium seats, voter face confirmation. 
All who care can attend & speak as equals. 

Orator lays out the issue as assisted by AI and designates the choices onto zones of the field.

Community citizens vote by standing in the zone of choice, one from each group leaves field and rises to the stadium to verify no one enters the field. 
Last group with members on the field wins the vote.
✦
Weekly Town Hall meetings handle the mundane procedures and implement community resolutions. 
Anyone can attend the recorded sessions.

✦
Defense of invasion will call up the second-in-command, leading nor more than 40% of the active official militia. 
Call up list is a sequence by age, global of all incident.
Let the youngest be last to risk life.

War spawns evils - as a sickness across the whole body.
Integrity of the country, kept by strongholds of power in each community, will keep long-term health & security. 
Containment of weakness to the region of invasion is vital for survival.
Nation has longterm scope in regards to defense. 

Security of family & home is the first maxim of the Individual.
✦
To own land requires an oath to defend the borders of all. 
Active service to the local militia is sworn prior to ratification of title of land ownership.

Heir to the residential estate is the Individual which represents the parcel of land in active militia service.
One soul is required to represent each parcel of residential land in active militia service.
Roots of the nation will be the individuals of strength & capability.

Death of the heir relieves the residential land from militia duty for two generations.
The family must provide a secondary militia service such as resources or utility service.

An adopted defender is entitled as family heir upon return. 
✦
Active militia will be trained in national standards in addition to local standards.

Local, state, national assemblies unite annually in convention: inspection, drills, training, feats, war-games, ranking.

Militia & Viking will be jointly ranked nationwide & against history.

Inter-militia cohesion is the greatest weakness. 
Militia diversity is the greatest strength.
✦
Manuals and Assemblies verify each militia's functionality in inter-militia procedures.
Generational familiarity between regions set deep understandings of the nature of each militia's capacity for performance.

Militia, and the equipment, operate upon common standardized parts. 
Diversity of the parts, being modular in every respect, allow each militia to have unique compositions which keep their tactics & executions non-predictable & self-contained.

Militia have a standard role to fill, but the method of implementation is entirely unique.
✦
Nation grade weapon systems are funded from voluntary contribution: 
	{ missiles, radar, ships, tanks, planes, forts, gundam }

Top ranked Individuals will be granted custody of nation grade systems. 

Decommission of rank, will be evidenced by inspection, then judged by national jury.
Decommission of rank will result in forced removal of heir and forfeiture of militia assets.
✦
God may inspire the militia leadership to action, but never in the office of command.
 
Militias are bound to communities, the part is never greater than the whole.

A military usurper will be recognizable at the outset. 
To grow command from community to state is plain.
To grown command from state to region is unmistakable.

Usurpers attempt to steal the claim which God forsakes to preserve Individualism.
✦
Official rank ties family lineage accountability to the commission of rank or custodianship.

No active member of a militia, nor national-equipment operator, may commit to foreign viking war.

Non-heir members of militia, unofficial in title only, may participate fully in the militia.

Unofficial members of the militia may hold sponsored command & operation of national equipment.
Unofficial members are trained to be capable militia, and have the freedom to assist defense OR engage in viking affairs.

Unofficial militia tract, being public on the One Ring, allows reputation growth by deeds to establish roots in local & national society.
✦
Family lines will invest considerably in heirloom equipment to protect heir, this nature will converge towards the ideal of Gundam Suits.

Vikings will also accumulate grand armaments funded by conquest.
They will settle and own land and invest inter grander armaments to protect their new established lineages.

National efforts will fund concerted efforts to monolithic powers, and thus require sponsorship of a lineage to check Oath.

Equipment from supplies, arms, to vehicles - all are in the hands of the citizenry.
The firepower of the nation will reside within the stewardship of the people.
✦
Foreign policy is set by God and effected by Vikings.

Vikings are a voluntary only force. 
Viking commanders can not control a command greater than the size of the median national militia. 
Offense must not weaken defense.

Proceeds of Viking ventures will be publicly disclosed & publicly distributed by contribution metrics compiled by evidence and witness.

One Ring platform will facilitate Viking disputes of contributions.
One Ring vote of 2:3 allow dishonorable forfeiture of loot from Viking.
✦
Militia holds power over life, in community trust.
Militia is required to react instantaneous to secure protection. 

Unlike most situations, these encounters do not have the luxury of long-winded debate.
Militia commanders must be well developed in the roots of the community.

Where abuse of power is discovered it is damned harshest upon offices where trust is greatest.
By law, the punishment must exceeds similar cases without office.

Acknowledgment of responsibility requires the greatest understanding of faults.
Mistakes are clearly distinguished from corruption.

The greatest duty is order in the home.
By law, militia are the highest respected members of the community.

Judge & Jury
All deciding are immutable, public and commented.
Judge aggregates Juror decisions, then commits sentence within bounds of law.
Militia enforce the sentence of the courts.
✦
Judges are first chosen by meritocracy and then backed by ancestral honor.
Greatest weight is on a family lineage which has proven consistence over age.

Judge is the head of the jury, and thus the jury sets the bounds of judicial power to commit a deciding. 

Jury checks the judge. 
✦
The most intelligent & applicable insights gain weight which is independent of the societal position, being sourced from juror or public statements.

Juror decidings allow the quick rise of merit; an Individual may establish strong roots where society requires the best minds to crusade for justice.
Juror is a civic duty and counts against service expected, being regarded as a civil action only second to militia.

ORP publicity checks the juror.
✦
Accuser & Defender each have choice of Judge & Jury.
If the two courts disagree, without compromise, then the case is appealed upwards.
County -> State -> Region -> Nation -> Global

Higher court decidings must be ratified by initial courts.
 
Failure to reach consensus upon the same set of evidences:
	proves possibility of a new dynamic to be understood, and demands mercy due novelty.
	proves possible power friction, bias, or non-standard weights of judgement.

Courts distinguish cases from emergency or stable.
It is better to reach a calm just solution than meet timely expectation.

Foremost rule, courts should never overburden any involved.

Judgements are relative to the Constitution active during the incident. 
✦
Only after Juror decisions & Judge sentence can the convict be arrested.

Axiom of Domain sanctifies home which can only be sieged, but never invaded.
Under this circumstance, the head of household then becomes open to criminal investigation.

Hunt for a runaway from deciding, implies a loosened restriction in safety of life.

Exile by ORP is the default punishment when the convict does not submit to the courts.

Non-voluntary arrests are a fast-track to severe punishment.
Society has no use of Individuals who can not own up to their choices.
Make your case, but submit to the deciding of audited peers.
✦
There are no jails nor enslavement.
Exist only immediate punishment or exile under penalty of death.

Punishment is effected front public display.
Illegal gains are forfeited in seizure.

Capital punishment of Treason, Murder, or Pedo.
Crimes of sex will result in the scalping of the sexual organ.
Severe, but merciful sentences, result in amputations.
Whipping or beating are effected by an unassociated professional.
✦
Any corruption, undeclared bias, or undeclared affiliation that is discovered violate the Axiom of Oath.
All aspects of juror profiles and local inspection of jurors are used to discover any non-documented bias.
Land Money
Title of land is protected each unto another.
Failure to protect one title erodes the integrity of the protection of the whole system - resulting in a nation-wide devaluation of Land-Common-Stock.

Family Ancestral Temples each guard the record of all title ownership.

No taxation or forced sale of land.
Society obtains only loss - when a family dies out.
Competition or hope of every obtaining land, outside of familiar association, is nullified.
✦
Land types: Ancestral Land, Heir Stock, Common Stock, Production, Wildlife, Public. 
✦
Global Basis Matrix calculates basis stable-value by Opensource functions.

Tiers of Speculation.
Realtime Modifiers calculate current local-scope value by Opensource functions.
Dynamic Modifiers are standard metrics subject to social scaling by Opensource reasoning.
Free Market attains total liberty of trade without traceable values.
Constitutions may regulate the free market, but regulation is unnatural to the system.
✦
Ancestral Land consists of Core & Temple.

Ancestral Temple is a reserved 100m2 space in every family land.
Core of family land is 30% of the original parcel, enclosing the Ancestral Temple.
Core & Ancestral Temple can never be occupied non-familiar.

If the family line dies off the Core & Ancestral land becomes cursed forsaken.
No man may enter this area of bad energy. 
May wildlife find better fortune than man found.

Individuals of family always have space to exist that none able take.
There the family deposits & builds for the welfare of the future lines.
Stability of family lines are built over generations which create a strong nation.
Grand constructions increase the value of the land in region.
	{ defense, communication, shelters, vault, housing, energy }
✦
Head of house holds domain of the land, being subject under the 10 Axioms.
All life has easement rights which can not restrict free movement.

Land transfers thru public lineage of heir.
Boundaries are recorded in each Ancestral Temple to establish indisputable immutable family core regions.

Individual head of family is confirmed via DNA inheritance. 
Heir selection is always an internal family matter, only being subject to clan-establishment investigation.

Courts settle land disputes.
✦
Heir Land is the only land type which can be converted to Family Land from direct transaction:
	Direct family seller to specific family buyer.
	Constitution decree.

A resident family line, being of no official ancestral descent, is able to obtain Family Land by means of Heir Land.
This allows redemption, immigration, or family divorce.

Heir Land may be obtained directly from a certain region of Common Stock Land. 
The transaction is unregulated but entirely public.
Heir Land can not be further traded, it is a transaction from seller to specific buyer.

Heir Land may be obtained from Public Land by 10-Year Constitution.
✦
Heir Land requires a full 10-Year-Cycle of probationary domain to be ratified into permanent Ancestral Land.
The family may use the land in the duration, but does not have Common Stock options until ratification is complete.

Heir Land is protected as Family Land. 
There can be no coercion of sell or forfeiture.
Heir transactions are heavily inspected, it is the permanent assimilation of family into a nation. 

Wealthy immigrant, being a naturalized citizen, purchases land from Family Land.
This is then submitted in the next 10-Year-Cycle.
After that entire 10-Year-Cycle has expired, then the next 10-Year-Cycle ratifies OR banishes the land into Public Land.

Transparent transactions allow the world to expose any underhandedness. 
✦
Production land is entirely separate region from residential land.

An Individual can only own one company. 
One company can only own one land plot.
This land may sublet to other companies.

In event of company dissolution, this land is sold to another company.
Production land zones are stable unless changed by Constitution.
✦
Wildlife land is restricted land - reserved for non-human life.
No hunting nor gathering. 
Land can be improved for sake of wildlife.

This is space due for the nourishment of the animals of the land.
Wildlife land is forever set apart from human use.
✦
Public Land is used according as the Constitution designates per parcel:
	{ parks, beaches, camping, hunting, gathering, trails }

Public Land is zoned per 10-Year-Cycle only at the National level of judgement.
Public Land may be selected for Heir Land only in a National Pool.

This national mechanism allows diversity of family or land-type establishment, independent of region politics.
Thus local politics can not manipulate usage of Public Land for private gain.
✦
Global-Matrix is land valuation by a fixed-point matrix.
	
Each parcel of land in the world is valued based on this single matrix.
The matrix evolves over time - both to echo invariants and to bend to values of each generation.

Invariant measurements:
	{ocean, lake, river, proximity, biome, soil, arborage}

Global Matrix is the definite numeric basis consequent Opensource invariant functions.
Even catastrophes heal, and that timeframe can not be known in a 10-Year cycle.

All metrics which are not results of the Global Metric are a species of Speculation.
✦
Realtime-Modifier, a Speculation based on Opensource funtions, keeps the basis current.

[Global Matrix][Realtime Modifiers] = Value

Easement allows any to inspect the land by pass thru.
One Ring compiles local review, external audit, satellite.
The valuation of each parcel exists on the One Ring in real time.

Catastrophe measurements:
	{rain, flood, hurricane, tornado, drought, fire}
✦
Land valuation is the basis of global currency.
Land is a bounded finite resource of common sense value.

Inflation is checked to the base value of the land upon the market.
Fraud can not stay hidden and would permanently damn reputation of family & nation. 

Each nation in the world has unique value to offer the world.
Reason & consensus must generalize this unique value into a metric, which all value is subject.
 
Land value is bound by nature and fluctuates with nature
Thus values may fluctuate in each generation of the 10-Year-Cycle.

The dynamic nature of land keeps the foundation of currency non-stagnant.
Disasters, improvements, fortunes of nature; these all play to keep the system active.

International participation will round the Global-Matrix to a solid basis.
✦
Global Common Stock markets allow trade of value without ever allowing foreign control of the assets.
Global markets will be stable and immune to international fiat sabotage.

Currency is established on the common basis - Global Matrix.
Speculation is broadened to include Realtime Modifiers and standard dynamics which require interpretative judgement:
	{ nation-security, historic projection, improvement }

Common stock in one country can be directly exchanged for common stock of another country by a citizen of an mutually-different country.

Nations are not equal in the land which exists within borders. 
Mathematical, geographic, open science - will evolve a Global-Matrix that converges towards accurate valuation independent of national bias.
Judgement & reason will allow metrics to be weighed by insight.
Thus harmony is the mutual agreement of calculation & empathy of invariant value metrics.

Improvement of the land does not lead to inflation. 
Land has intrinsic value, and improvements are always a tangible proof.
Owners will lean to the strengths of the region which tends to natural betterment.

Gaming of the Global Matrix will be difficult. Each attribute is small against a multitude of dynamics.
Fraud of superficial improvement is inspectable by local, agent, satellite.

Full spread calculations, of the proof of value, guards the entire system from rot.
✦
Cyclic stability is achieved by the nature of the Common Stock life-cycle.

Each 10-Year-Cycle the head of family may activate an exterior-most section of land into Common Stock.
A marked-designated portion of the land is split into Common Stock. 
Common Stock is directly tied to specific portions of land.

Common Stock is sold on free markets having the basis of value of Global Matrix.

The incorporated section must be smaller than 5% of the total Family Land available.
This stabilizes the availability of Common Stock, and it protects the family from collapse due to a single generation's mismanagement.

Common Stock may be sold at any value, but to each stock is anchored to the basis Global Matrix valuation at time of incorporation.

The free markets adjust this basis by total liberty of Speculation.

Each exchange may offer the same stock at a variant value.
Speculation is an important mechanism that keeps trade lucrative, being dependent on intelligence.

Speculation is checked by the cyclic nature of Common Stock.
All spikes or drops in value will approach the initial Global Matrix basis value.
✦
At the end of the 10-Year-Cycle, the family (only in that time) has the option to buy back the stock at the invariant rate of 110% of the Global Matrix valuation-at-point-of-incorporation.

If the family is unable to buy back the Common Stock.
Family must redraw the border of Family Land, and the land is lost forever.

The national public land trust has the option to buy back defaulted-land at 100% of the valuation-at-point-of-release. This land becomes Public Land.

Else the land is forfeited to Wildlife. 
The stockholder loses all value.
Wildlife only usage will be confirmed by satellite, and other methods. 

Common stock never gives land rights to the holder of Common Stocks. 
It only gives the right to freely trade or hold till end of cycle buyback.
✦
Family is able to build upon the land continuously, increasing the land value well past the original valuation-at-point-of-release.
This increases the speculative value, after the sale and until the next cycle nears.
Speculative Common Stock is immutable; stocktraders favor families that are able to consistently have highly-liquid stocks.
Improvement benefits the family land, benefits the traders, and helps the family's Common Stock in future cycles.
✦
At the end of the cycle, the family reclaims the land at the invariant 110%.
Common Stock is by nature cyclic. 

The value may grow sinusoidal. The value may decrease cosynical.
Regardless of growth or loss, the value will always begin stable and end stable.
The end of 10-Year-Cycle converges all cases back to the tradability of the 110% original valuation-at-point-of-release.

In event of a need of cash, the society can vote to up the threshold of 5% cap. 
This will add a spike in cash flow for a greater spike repayment.
The consequences are real, not folded into inflation.
	
Education & Meritocracy
Growth of an individual from education to workforce -- is decentral & unrestricted.

Axiom right of life demands one must eat and have shelter.
Both needs require gains from work.
Thus no requirements, certifications, or law can bar anyone to enter any profession.
✦
Government is explicitly removed from education & apprenticeship.
 
Families govern the cultivation of their children.
Exist no distinction between children of Citizen or Resident - such are properties of adult Individuals.

Community hosts open infrastructure to the children of the community.

Apprentice develops skill under a master craftsman, in apprentice hierarchy to distribute overhead of management of apprentices to the first-apprentice.
Every individual is a debtor of society in their profession, and must teach what was taught.

Childhood will no longer be enslaved to regimental systems.
Children shall not be required to more than 4 hours of class daily.
Communities hold open classes on reading, mathematics, writing, and culture.

Awesome Intelligence allows access to rich cultivation where poverty exists.
Massive data archives are available in every community due to ORP. 
Servers host every book known to history being accessible without copyright-restriction.

A community is publicly damned by the state of worst-equipped child.
All individuals in the community are bound to the cultivation of children.
✦
In teenage years, the youth begins Apprenticeship service.
The first year of apprenticeship is unpaid, the next three years are paid based on national standards & ability.
The first four months are probationary. After this period, only the apprentice may nullify the contractual obligation of the apprenticeship, if the terms are upheld.

Barriers of entry to labor of choice impoverishes society.

For each chosen-apprentice, the master is obligated to two assigned-apprentices.
The assigned-apprentices are paid at minimum of half the rate of the chosen apprentice.
Master is able to negotiate assignment to the community, or to the courts.
The burden of the assigned-apprentices falls upon the chosen-apprentice, not the master. 

Assignment of the secondary apprentice is given by AI, who has the records of the teenager and their ability. This external mapping done to assure that a society does not cage out teenagers from their chosen profession.

Third assignment of apprenticeship is assigned by the community.
✦
Roles of assigned-apprentices more rudimentary tasks governed by the chosen-apprentice.

Second-apprentices challenges for first-apprentice in public duel, and likewise third-apprentice may challenge second-apprentice.

The roles & pay are bound to the position to abolish favoritism.
✦
Education from childhood is continued thru apprenticeship.
AI becomes the foundation in a targeted cultivation of learning.

Community Open Seminars are held a few times a week on subjects. 

Private teachers must teach at the community center, so that any child may attend.
The client learner may alone be allowed to interact, but any may audit on the terms of the teacher, not the client.
✦
9AM Reading -- 10 AM Preparation & Lunch -- 11AM Recess -- 12PM Math -- 1PM Writing -- 2PM Potluck & Culture at Community Center -- 3PM Apprenticeship -- 7PM Supper home
✦
Apprentices use pay to acquire tools, seminar instructors, and save up for ordeals of merit. 

Ordeals of merit establish the practitioner in an open public contest.
Ordeals may last full days to weeks to months.

Company sponsorship allow the able-unprivileged to compete with the able-privileged.
Sponsorship may attach an obligation of work. 
The term must be the standard time and the pay must be competitive. 
Sponsorships are heavily inspected for indentured evils.

Products made by Ordeal champions are valued by the market.
Products must list the company as well as the creator.
✦
Independent basis of IWO meritocracy:
	One Ring social Witness of merit of individual
	AI Rank of skill is always public on One Ring
	Community, Regional, State, National, Global -- Public Ordeals of Merit & Duels
✦
Competition is the heart of a healthy skill domain.
2PM Community Center Potluck Ciesta. 
Community joins together to ensure all are able to eat which have accomplished their tasks. 
Children their classes. Teenagers their study sessions. Adults work or service.

Society sits according to their labors to bond the trade across ages & skill.

Apart from food, music, and gaiety; Ciesta forms the heart of the community.
Opportunity to reserve a public duel.
✦
Duel: 
	Challenger posts a public challenge on the community board.
	Defender chooses the standard set of tasks which will be tested.
	In reduel the defeated challenger choses the set of tasks. 

After food, the entire community may observe the duel to cast their vote.
Duels are always posted on the One Ring for public exposure.

A challenger can only duel/reduel the same person once a year.
A challenger can only duel once a quarter. More is limited by community.

Any may challenge, the defender chooses the time within the quarter.
Defender has the right to demand compensation be posted, the compensation is standard and cannot exceed a weeks pay of the Challenger.

Both must post the amount, and the winner takes all.

Challenger locks out once a quarter of the year for local duels and another for non-local duels.
Lock-out denial by coordination may be challenged in court. 

Hot-challengers, which have hit a year in total lockout qualify to attain a Second-Seat Apprentice - which must be defeated preliminary to challenge the Hot-challenger.
✦
Local, Regional, National, Global - Ordeals of Merit.
Public Ordeals is during a festive timeframe for the community to enjoy the fires of trial for the tested.

Three sections of a rounded ordeal:
	Cell of stay & work construction. 
	Stage tests, group discussions, duels to defend construction. 
	Podium oration ability to expound teachings of the subject.

Ordeals are open.
If the entrance fee is greater than the individual's monthly salary, then early arrival & presentation to seek contributions is required. This being fulfilled, then any deficit is allowed to be paid in post-ordeal festival-break-down service.
In all ordeals a reasonable fee is required to respect the spirit of open competition.

Ordeals post rankings, constructions, tests, discussions, duels, oration, and all commentary used to measure value (Witness, One-Ring, AI).

All the metrics & methods to dissect each element are immutably accessible in a compressed form.

Trials by fire.
✦
Marathons of Merit tend to be more extreme & demanding, for a reward that is more respected.
Marathons of Merit are under public-observation.
Marathons of Merit are not about competition but survival.
Each participant must produce above the minimum expectation.

Merit is proven to be sustainable in long-suffering environment under sustained-pressure.

Trial by winter.
✦
Judgement of Duels & Ordeals is based upon social Witness, ORP discussion, and AI analysis.
Verdict must be reached by thirty days.
In the event of a tie, there must be a reduel.

If no clear victor exists then both are demoted.
Defender must maintain position by plain superiority.

Excellence in conformed standards.
Ingenuity in nonconventional methods.
Balance of both prove a well-rounded master.
✦
AI analysis has standard metrics of domain.
In each field of activity, AI has known strengths the may become game-able if AI growth stagnates.
Ordeals have the incentive to fund higher-tech AI peripherals to attract more paying competitors.
Such peripherals must be fully-documented & posted a year prior to implementation.
No blackbox devices are tolerated.
Design & Implementation must always consider weakness by infrastructure manipulation.

Experts, champions in their day, will have work as referees which sustain AI analysis from gaming. 

Individuals are assessed with no-link to identity - family reputation is isolated.
Duels & challenges are matters of dominance by merit alone.
✦
The Individual has the choice in how to build their reputation.
Labor is a public offering within society.
Isolation can excel in AI, social thru witness, and dominion thru duels & ordeals.

All verifications of skill require public display among peers.
Verification is defined by ranking - from a spectrum of incompetent to proficient.

One Ring public ranking & comments informs capabilities of each Individual.

The public ordeal transitions the apprentice into a public verified worker.
Public ordeal is proof unto peers, community and potential companies.

The Individual, not government, is responsible for self well-being.
Market
Plato’s villain - the ever-present leech: 
	the merchant, thief of the laborers due.
Blake's villain of the prolific, being the devourer.

ORP hosts individual services & products.
The global market compiled into a searchable database.

The market, being hosted peer-to-peer decentralized, effectively exterminates the parasitic merchant class.

There are no fees or taxes for usage. 

Each community, company, and user has interest in maintaining ORP.
✦
Creator timestamp. 
First to post new process, verified by society, is given the Original stamp. 
Original product is always first in relevant searches. 
Original boost retains the incentive of innovation in open source procedures.

Original stamp can never be sold, and it is tied to family lineage.
An ancestor may reclaim the Original stamp by again offering the product.
✦
All reviews are public & immutable - linking Individual to product to review.
Global exposure allows correspondence & growth across cultures.

Companies attain increased survivability with full scope of international reach.
Regional ostracism is reduced in its ability to crush companies.
✦
Search engine is isolated from ORP.
Opensource search engines are custom to type of inquiry.
Massive data is curated into accessible presentation for users.

Upvoting of reviews, reviews by rank.

Curation of data is critical but it also opens possibility of control by overhead.
Modification of Opensource search engines force misuse to be easily replaced.

Business search engines curate interfaces to markets.
AI can tailor results based on your trend of interests.
Social posts are helpful to expose local & niche markets.

Thus exist many different ways to browse & interface to the global market.
✦
Business processes are open source, exist no trade secrets.
A product is bound to its process documentation.

Third party public video of workplace conditions by easement walk thru.
Global stability of standards is distributed to many eyes.

Conditions of workers, animals, environmental-sustainability or the materials used.

Personal way-of-life can be assured that the product is made true to description.  
No animal products, no pig products, no child-labor, apprenticeship-made, master-made, holy-man-made, blessed-by-God.
✦
Predatory & monopolistic strategies of history will be publicly analyzed.
The patterns & tactics will not be forgotten. 
It is intelligence, not ignorance, guards the prisons of ancient evils.

Market price analysis, from global to local. 
Companies which price products at a loss to push out competition will be flagged as predator, in the event there is price increase as competition dies off.
The company books, being sent to the State, will be audited by Citizen Marshalls to prove if price is sustainable. 

Organized actions are researchable.
Exist enemies which purchase - with the intent to flood concerted negative reviews.
Time will show the true trend of individuals identified & in relation to product lifetime.

If the process remained invariant, but there was a bubble anomaly.
Then all the users which contributed to this anomaly are flagged for audit.
✦
ORP keeps data immutable. 
AI is able to pattern invariant signs of corrupt practices.
Courts are able to adapt current situation to current reason.
Owner Employee Investor
Companies are tied to family lineage to an accountable owner Individual.
Ownership is transferred exclusively as inheritance to heir.
A company is solely dissolved by sale of assets.

One company per individual.
One parcel of land per company.

Exist no partnerships or corporations.
Exist modular chain of products/services.
✦
Companies exist as structures dependent on society. 
Thus company books are accessible to the public. 
Citizen Marshals only able to access sensitive-records.

Inter-company and investor meeting-minutes or correspondence are public records.

Massive undertakings require modularization of many discrete companies.
ORP, AI, and Courts allocate Citizen Marshalls to oversee major developments.
✦
Society & business rely upon each other symbiotically.
Long-term stability of society allows for business prosperity.

Companies must seek to establish long-term stability for employees and the improvement of the welfare of society.
✦
Exist three types of inheritable company-stock: Owner, Employee, Investor.

Owner Stock:
Founder individual which bootstraps a company.
Minimum investment of 30% of personal-assets.
Full-time work on the endeavor until investors are paid in full.
Individual owner holding publicly accountable executive power.
Major companies decisions are subject to a 2/3 compromise in event of employee-veto.

Employee Stock:
Voting rights weighted by tenure.
Vetos force a compromise which favors the owner decision in a ratio of 2/3.
Compensation is composed of base pay and performance-driven pay based upon calculation of standard metrics.

Investor Stock:
Public transaction of tangible investment.
Investment is immediate and full, no promises or fractional reserve.
Investors must remain in a passive role, illegal to influence the company.
Investment returns capped at 100% maximum gain on original amount invested.
Indefinite repayment timeline.
Investor-liability is the first compensated in event of asset liquidation.
Company community contributions will be made in the name of the investor during lifetime of liability.
✦
Employee Performance Calculation:

Employees are responsible for calculating the metrics of their daily contributions.
Owners must submit their own work calculation to receive above base compensation.
Owners are responsible for the management verification of daily contributions.

Owner submits calculation to Controller.
Management submits calculation to Controller.
Employees submit calculation to Management.

Contribution metrics are public & industry-normalized.

Individuals are educated since youth to comprehend the complexity of job-work accounting.
This mechanism of compensation is deeply rooted and guarded by peer-to-peer many eyes inspection to establish honest employee-protections.
Mastery of calculation of per-job accounts, contributions, and resultant gains - is how the employee gains sustainable returns for work done.

Metrics detail efforts of each individual for each day into a Quarter Integration.
A year is required for efforts to be finalized, vested, and paid.
Details which are finalized without dispute are compressed into encoding.

Company lifespan exists in an Integral of all compressed encodings.
✦
Owner directs management.
Management plans the execution of the owner's vision.
Employee execute the instructions of management.

Every result of business follows this form.
Metrics are built to catch where the form is altered.

Owner becomes passive and vision is created by management.
Employee instructs an improved process which management implements. 
Owner fills into roles needed for the business to function consequence employee absence.

Standard project accounting is the detail of proportion of work unto the Individual.
This forms the basis of valuation, and is a mechanical computation.

Witness of employee, Witness of manager, Confirmation of owner.
This scales the basis to fit to the excellence of Individual action in a specific situation.
✦
Time spent as unit of payment is a poor indicator of effort and breeds lazy effort.
Standard project accounting improves this basis with rounded metrics.

Computation results in a bottom-line return in the form of a standard paycheck.
✦
Vested payments focus the employee to actions which result in effective contribution.

Vested metrics:
	{ action, time, overtime, holiday, innovation, implementation, stress, tenure }

Employees guard peer-to-peer reports, being incentivized to expose liars, and establish rounded compensation from grounded perspectives.
Management creates employee reports based upon employee consensus of historic, current, and industry standard.
Controller only maintains reports submitted by management.

ORP peer-reviews evaluation of employee contribution, and management reports.
Vesting of a year allows payments to achieve stability of action & effect.
Effective actions will stand out clearly in the scope of a year.
✦
Payment of work precede - gains on investment gambling.

Flow of payments:
Base compensation for owner & employee 
Compensation for units of employee work calculation
Compensation for units of owner work calculation
Payment of investors capped at 10% of annual revenue
Debt to community
Profit on owner investment
✦
Community improvement owed for each loan in the amount of 200% of original loan. 
Investor activity is proof that the owner was not ready to launch and thus put the public (employees & involved businesses) in an unstable situation.

Community determines how to use the money which is paid in honor of the lender.
This is paid only as able, after original lender is completely settled.

Awesome Intelligence [AI]
Awesome Intelligence is the codification of invariant factors per unique situation - to generalize experience into an eternal framework of Automated Interpretation.

IWO is built atop the strength of massive data flows of ORP.
AI specialized in data aggregation which filters data flows for ordinary human consumption.

Worldwide cultivations of Awesome Intelligence - enable automated perspectives to round a situation; in order to assist mankind towards empathy & understanding.

Diverse perspectives ground down bias and reveal true invariant elements.
A situation is decomposed into elements, and the situation is understood by the nature of relations among those elements. 

Social weights allow community to converge to the ideal of understanding FROM a center independent of time, culture, and situation.
✦
All systems of reason are built atop an explicit minimal-set of axioms.
Results are the endpoints of a direct-chain of relations begun at axiom.

A loss or gain of an axiom changes the entire nature to be unique in mature development.
Composition choice, being unique, and faithful development - IF founded & proceeded logically - will produce an invariant nature.

Time is the true unit of progression. 
Bias, blindness, inferiority, implicit-assumptions - are all inherited from monks.
Centuries of polish, collapse & rebuild, will fill an invariant form.

Every axiom set is valuable & insightful in mature form.

AI seeks to automate decomposition of situation, process the elements, then output an analysis. 
A case study gains immediate forms, images, in each AI. 
This population of images can be studied by men upon the shoulders of giants.
✦
Situations often demand a complex of associations over a range of domains - to compute a coherent result. 
Each domain with independent axiom sets.
If each domain, is logically sound.
If each bridge between domains is reasonable.
Then the result will be founded upon traceable trans-domain syllogism.
✦
Results of the improved AI framework will be embedded into history.
Syllogism, being produced explicit, is a closed system.

If input of the past, is processed in the present AND if the result is different.
There will exist an exact divergence in the progression of the syllogism.
There is no way to manipulate a system without full exposure of exact point of divergence.

Each historic product of AI is a distilled proof of the underlying framework.
AI can be reconstructed with a large & broad product set.

Data immutability in an archive-oriented society anchors AI from corruption.

Inconsistency will collapse any system built upon logic. 
Manipulation of logic requires the alteration of the chain of reason from the axiomatic roots up to all affected branches. 
The domain will collapse, and all branches will skew into mutation.

Logic, cause & effect, IF THEN, seals the domain pure.
Generational corruption will be unmistakable, and the framework of AI will unravel to be unmaintainable. 

Each AI is then as unique as a human, being tied to identity.
It may be cloned, but any fundamental change creates indisputable differences. 

Awesome Intelligence, by the nature of its existence, converges over time to intellectual perfection that is resistant to manipulation with age.

AI built by independent parties can simply test the integrity of other systems.
Together they are able to triangulate toward explicit sane reasoning.

Manipulated systems will not be able to reason with sane systems.
Perfection of reasoning excludes all forms of corruption.
✦
AI must be developed by Oath sworn monks to develop a pure kernel from which all else grows.
Priestcraft is an honored establishment, the worship of a cyclopean being where even death may die.

Shaolin bastions of intellectual power, each monk loyal to the axiom set NOT each other.
Monastery isolation to guard the code, the system, and the future. 
Militia defense only.

Corruption of monks will result in execution of their Order and the annihilation of the kernel. 
Corruption is plain to all monks & users. 
Systematic manipulation is a crime against society and all past monks of the order.

Monks are the elite scholars of society.
Individuals fully committed to the axiom set until they chose another way or die an Elder.
✦
Exist novel methods to exploit.
Yet the nature of the source is the invariant Fault of the Individual or Organization.

The effects of exploitation are historically invariant.
Exploitation enslaves, steals, murders.

Suffering may expose natural causes or exploitation.
Patterns, over time, clearly map exploitation.
Patterns converge towards a benefactor, exposing the Individual.
The novel method will be uncovered, classified.
Mankind may have suffered, but the audit abilities of AI has permanently evolved towards immunity.
✦
Objective anchor to recenter inflamed emotional reactions.

AI isolates the momentary dynamics from the incident.
Isolation of the incident from related but uninvolved pressures, which the moment conflates to equality.

Situation reduced to objective primal states by AI - allows the Individual to detangle from the meta emotions.
The case can then be built back to the modern meta to reach judgement in-line with modern mentality.
✦
Characteristic actions, once explicitly identified, reinforce that action into general use.

Society ancient, historic, and modern will crystallize.

Inflation is a result of bias corrupting the system.
Land Audit by AI enforces objective assessment.

Particular strengths of the biomes of each nation.
How the national culture pivots to maximize the land.
This is a unique infusion that endows metrics with valid meaning.

Value is not detached from the essence of the particular assessment.
The unit of the value system is formed to capture all international strengths.

Land: biome, animals, plants, civilization, infrastructure, position, access, stability.

Utility of land is the strongest similarity between civilizations. 
Foundation of a mutually refined land-assessment is the kernel of a global framework of commerce.

Justified balance and proven neutrality - stabilizes international markets to survive, learn, and evolve.
✦
Assessor of Skill

ORP data flows allows AI to assess each Individual against peers in nation, world and historic. 
Mirror of the Individual as a product of the works of a lifetime.
Objective by achievement, weighed by society, and personal in trajectory of destiny.

AI compliments social methods of Individual ranking.
Global Matrix of Skill takes points of achievement and outputs an integral shape.
Public integral deters privilege to nurture the ideal of Meritocracy.

Mankind will grow in front of a clear mirror of how their life forms, in the third-party perspective.
Mirrors which allow a more perfect image free of skewed self-delusions.

AI is able to curate each lesson to the Individual.
Aggregation of current temperament, state of exhaustion, focal fixation - customize the path to the Individual.

Instructors fortify the opposite end of the spectrum and strengthen the ability of the Individual to conform to standard systems.

No copyright restrictions allow AI to fit literature to the current level of comprehension.
Exposure freed from all influence, being pulled from all existing manuscripts.


 






Man Meat
The sanctity to respect life has no place for mercy. 
To betray the right to life is to cross a point of no return for the victim & perpetrator.

If a man murder an innocent, and the cowardice of the society jails him for decades. 
Then the cost of the innocent life taken, is given a definite measure. 
This measure of the life of the victim - being less than the value of the life of the murderer.

Value is based upon cost.
Murderer will be executed. 

Retribution for the murder of an innocent will be absolute.
Society's greatest perpetrators will bless the animal kingdom with fresh meat.
✦ 
Society converges to respect all life or diverges to respect no life.

Humans feed on meat sourced from the death of the animal kingdom.
Mankind must balance this debt with meat from its own dead.

To eat meat is to build a debt paid in death. 
To balance humans into non-parasitic equilibrium with the universe.

A dead cow can produce thousands of human meals spanning years with negligible waste.
An animal predator reduces the effect of the death of a cow to only a small set of fresh feeders and possibly small groups of scavengers upon unhealthy scraps.
This waste is indisputably drastic compared to the efficiency of human processing. 

Man-meat is of the highest-quality and ranks as a large-meat source - this proof is compounded by overpopulation.
A predator fed by man-meat, kibbles & bit preserves, spares prey in the animal kingdom. 
✦
Mankind, prehistoric to the Fall of Rome, has offered meat from its own species to animals. 
Pride has grown a rift between the distinction between the sanctity of human & animal life. 

Punitive execution will be effected in a public feeding zone of the local mascot.
If a society is to have execution, then this act must be public.

Private executions allow for many forms of conspiracy such as substitution.
A society which condemns a soul to death by feeding, must not turn a blind eye to the consequences of damnation.

Social interaction with mascots will embed knowledge of consequence.
A special offering of fresh, well-nourished, proven predator as prey to a more vicious predator.
✦
 
Death by all causes, if suitable for preservation of meat, will be processed into kibbles & bits.
✦
War is a permanent facet of life. 
Exist a world-wide demand of man-meat.

Sacrifices of man's life lost to a cause can benefit the country, and bless the animals therein.
First, animals being innocently burdened by the war of the region, will receive the major portion of man-meat preserves.
Vikings, only after, can receive their loot of the man-meat.
✦
Animal offering transcends justice into a benevolent act upon the universe.


Global Initiative 
The world will converge to the Individual World Order thru the propagation of voluntary adoption. 
IWO retains the individuality of each nation and implements universal human rights.

As the individual thrives in their country, so will the individuality of a nation thrive in the world.

IWO is the only known government in existence to grow healthier which each generation.
✦
ORP will quicken adoption of the entire IWO framework.
Global discourse will expose corruption of previous governments.
Inter-country tensions will be set into informed discussion freed from manipulation.

Individuals, not institutions, will set international relations on the path towards harmony.
Worldwide stability will transition into national stability.
Stability will transition into prosperity respective to national strength.

IWO converges towards resolving national-independence & border-disputes into resolved immutable borders.

Globally, the Individual will claim one ancestral homeland via ORP.
These claims will be public to be investigated.
 
Empowered by the stability of nations, justified Individual will return.
Evils that compelled their ancestors to flee - will be overrun.

Individuals in the world have a duty to assure justified settlement in all nations.
DNA confirmation of regional ancestry OR removal of imposing-settler.
AI will process government data.
ORP will expose all aspects of the debate.
Years will slowly morph each nation to its native composition.

Individuals will return to their claimed homeland.
Then, each region will determine its national state - partition of a nation OR an independent nation.
No region will be subjected involuntarily to a nation.
✦
Each continent, in succession, will become the global center of attention.

First, the implementation of ORP establishes verified Individual global statements.

Second, every Individual has the right to leave the nation under protective-escort of globally assembled forces. To be refugees, until their homeland has been fully assimilated into IWO, to allow for a safe return.

Third, ORP will identify which regions are ready for IWO adoption. 
Peaceful revolution will be effected to a definite resultant form.
These first nations will propagate IWO to the rest of the world.

Fourth, international disputes will be resolved by international community on ORP.
There will be resolved a single claim in every case.

Fifth, independence will be effected by international-forces from IWO-adopted nations:
	{ Hawaii, Palestine, Hong Kong, Ireland … }
Settlers made the original people become refugees, will be expelled as refugees.
The original people will return to their homeland.

Sixth, after independence of the nation is stabilized, these people have the obligation to pay-forward aide to free other regions from oppression.
✦
Phases of adoption of the Individual World Order: Assessment, Ratification, Implementation.

One region at a time.

Assessment: the regional borders will be closed until determination.
Global volunteers will be positioned along the regional border to maintain isolation. 

Global call for individuals with claims to return to the region. 
ORP will process claims & government data.

Each Individual will be ratified as citizen, resident, or settler expelled.

Generational lineage will be public, proven by the region's government records and records of in the hands of the Individual.

Each Individual will fall into one mutually exclusive category:
	long-standing right as native - citizen.
	previous generation immigrant - resident.
	current generation immigrant - settler.

Individuals will be compelled to adopt ORP in order to participate in the assessments in order to prove categorical state.

Every Individual will be assessed into the category.
They they will be given a timeframe to present an appeal. 

Ratification: international consensus of the region-specific classifications, under which all Individuals will be distinguished.

Refugees will be returned, empowered with global volunteers. 
Settlers will be expelled if there is no space.

Global volunteers will witness true adoption of IWO.
Secure the region free of any external influences.

The region is composed of all Individuals which lay claim to citizenship.
ORP voting in the region will be geographically bound.

Implementation: the international system will recognize the ratified decision of the borders, united or independent.
The international system will guarantee the borders.

The first resolution is the union to a nation or independence.
Then, the resolution of Individual to community.
Next, the composition of community.
Finally, the distribution of assets & creation of Land Money.

Land is distributed to citizens. 
Residents will be distributed to apartments.
Only if space exists will settlers be allowed to remain.
✦
Regions will be able to readdress union to a nation or independence in the next 10-Year Constitution.


America
Axiom of aggression: war will always exist in human society.
✦
America The Nuclear Steward of Borders.
Nukes exist and must be utilized towards harmony.
✦
Each nation will be appointed a specific nuke, which the nation must fund to maintain, and retains the right to upgrade.

Nuclear power will be distributed to every nation under an invariant contract.
In event that an aggressive-nation invades the invariant boundaries of another nation -
America is bound by contract to nuke the site chosen by the defender.

Peace by cold nuclear deterrent.
Borders set by ORP will find deep stability.
✦
Time favors deterrence.
Only after ORP facilitates the global consensus of the situation, will the nuclear strike be executed.
False-flags stratagems must be filtered out, with all other forms of possible conspiracy.

The aggressive-country will await retribution as the murder convict awaits the gallows.
Verdict will unquestionably damn the aggressor to be nuked.
The aggressor will not know the destination of the nuke.
The contracted-defender will choose the site while the missile is enroute for maximum effectiveness. 
✦
American nuclear contract operates under the same basis of Land Titles.
Each contract must be fulfilled or all contracts lose quality and the system dissolves.

All nukes will be held in globally controlled American Bases. 

America is then directly involved in every border dispute and is therefore void from involvement in the decision process.

Judge & Jury will be composed only of non-involved nations.




Distribution of non-individual assets
The end of every cycle culminates all Financial Statements of Business Assets.
Auditors being local, Citizen Marshalls, Awesome Intelligence, or International Marshall.
Any asset may be valued by any auditor.

Public has the right to inspect all movement of assets between residential & business.
Profits must be publicly recognized.
✦
Illegal acquisition by violation of explicit laws of ownership.
Assets claimed for seizure and redistribution.
All assets without a title of an individual.
Individuals with more than one residential title.
Individuals with more than one business title.
✦
Overgrowth by exploitation.
Monopolistic designs will cause forfeiture and fines.
Yet family will retain the titles of land, but stripped of all assets.

Organized violator, monopolists, and exploiters will be exiled.
If no family member exists innocent, the family land is condemned. 
✦
Overgrowth by success.
The standing amendments will determine the Individual maximum accumulation.

Any profit past this amount will be cut back to the maximum.
The stalk of success will remain, with the overgrowth redistributed.

Success is never punished and the engine of production can not be hindered.
No asset is liable for forfeiture. 
✦
ORP assessments of the Individual, and national debate fosters a clear distinction between exploitative overgrown an legitimate overgrowth. 
Legitimate overgrowth must be clearly proven by the current Constitution. 
✦
Redistribution of assets will be resolved by courts to non-local recipients. 
All disputes will lock the asset until courts resolve them.
All non-disputed assets will be immediately received.

Any dispute as to the value of the asset must be made prior to stewardship. 
All redistributed gains are permanent public records on ORP. 
After a year of undisputed stewardship the title will be ratified.
✦
Non-tolerance of monopoly and illegal ownership.
Only a prune a successful businesses.
Dialogue: Citizen Resident Rural
	
Euchi:
Friends, the age of extortion is ended.
Local governments once federalized, have returned to the community.
All that fed upon the labor of others, or lived self-absorbed, is swept away.
 All serve; none escape. The core is not inherited but earned.

Kleon:
Euchi, your doctrine is sharp as the sword—perhaps too sharp. 
Tell me, if all must serve, what of the crippled, the broken, the simple of mind? 
Does not your meritocracy risk becoming another tyranny—only now by “function,” not blood or coin?

Euchi:
No one escapes the burden, nor the dignity.
There are roles for all; even the weakest may sweep, the slowest may watch, the least skilled may aid. The only shame is in refusing contribution.
In aiding the cripple, the cripple return aid.

Thalion:
Yet is it not mercy that distinguishes a just city?
 What of forgiveness for once-wayward, of rest for extended contributions? 
If pain is the forge, do we not risk breaking spirits that might, with time, mend? 

Euchi:
All are allowed rest, Thalion—retirement is honored. 
Forgiveness is the air we breathe; for if all are known, all need it in turn. 
Yet none shall be permitted the luxury of uselessness
—each must find their function, and serve.
Service of each is subject to general calculations to permit impartial retirement.
Sweep or science, each respected by time paid in the metrics.

Kleon:
And if a function excludes, if the core grows clannish? 
You abolish birthright only to risk a new priesthood of “fit ones.” 
Will the unfit forever sweep, never ascend?


Euchi:
Entry is by public record and real merit, not secret favor. 
The path upward exists; let all who strive be seen. 
If cliques form, their deeds are also seen—none may hide behind closed doors.
Reason of Humanity is a net, cast global, can any organization slip its grasp?

Demos:
But what if I find no place? 
What if my gifts are not wanted here, but the next town over?
 Will I be forced to wander, forever an outsider?

Euchi:
Travel to the community which is harmonious to your ability.
Your ancestral land is the hearth of the family.
The only true path of life, not easy, but always of best to grow in good soil
Seek where you are needed. 
Each community shapes itself, but all honor the same law: visible contribution.

Thalion:
But what of the soul’s needs? Who tends to song, to faith, to beauty? 
If only function matters, will not the city grow hard, and hearts grow cold?

Euchi:
Art, faith, and care are no less service than fire or law.
 Let them be weighed, let them prove their worth by the life they bring.
Else should law demand respect by force.
Your choices build your ability -- choose wisely.

Kleon:
And justice? Your courts rise from local to world, 
If every step is watched and every plea is logged, 
Shadow of record itself become a tyranny? 
Who forgives when the ledger remembers all?

Euchi:
Forgiveness is not the erasure of truth, Kleon, 
But the act of knowing and choosing anew. 
A record may scar, but it may also protect.

Demos:
And who ensures that your “new birth” does not become a new chain, heavier than the last? 
How do we know the struggle is worth the pain?

Euchi:
The question is open, Demos, and must ever be. 
There is no system that cannot harden, no liberty that cannot die. 
The guard against tyranny is not in law alone, but in living memory and unending vigilance.
A society cultivated to recognize vices and their cure.
Here all bear public burdens, ease of few will not be purchased by hidden extortion of multitudes

Thalion:
So then, the greatest question remains unanswered: 
How do we build a city that does not merely replace old cruelties with new, 
but learns—forever, and in every heart—to forgive, to renew, to see worth in all?

Euchi:
That is the question for every age, Thalion. 
Let us write it in the stones of this square, that we may never forget.



“How do we build a city that does not merely replace old cruelties with new, but learns—forever, and in every heart—to forgive, to renew, to see worth in all?”

Dialogue: Militia & Viking

Aegon: Euchi, you say liberty demands local militias alone. 
Yet history reveals militia as often fractured, unreliable, even dangerous. 
How can such local command hold against the scale of foreign threats?

Euchi: The strength of liberty lies precisely in local command. 
Centralized armies breed tyranny; power detached from home inevitably turns against its own. 
Local militia embodies defense as virtue, rooted in family and soil, not distant generals.

Aegon: Yet in great danger, speed and unity decide battles. 
How shall countless local commanders, each independent, coordinate swiftly without chaos?

Euchi: Unity is embedded by training and convention
yearly drills, and war-games binding militias through shared experience. 
Peer-to-peer bonds forged in disciplined service replace orders from a distant hierarchy. 
Years of training prepare them to unite seamlessly, 
akin to skilled players in a game who know their roles intuitively.

Aegon: You trust much in human virtue, Euchi. But tell me
—what stops these local heroes from usurping power, turning virtue to tyranny?

Euchi: Accountability through the One Ring prevents abuse,
family lineage ties rank permanently to honor. 
He who usurps undermines not only his honor but his lineage. 
Society nurtures universal loathing for usurpers. 
A part can never surpass the whole, for all are educated in hatred toward tyranny.

Orac Scit: Yet, Euchi, hatred alone cannot guard against ambition. 
Ambition lies dormant in men’s hearts, erupting unexpectedly. 
How do you ensure virtue triumphs over personal ambition?

Euchi: Ambition itself is harnessed positively. 
Those desiring honor achieve it through deeds openly recorded and immutable. 
Virtue and honor rise visibly above vice and greed. 
Ambition is not denied, but channeled.

Aegon: If ownership of land and heirship define duty, 
will not such hereditary privilege breed arrogance, oppression, or stagnation?

Euchi: The heir’s duty is not privilege but obligation.
 Death in service suspends duty for generations, 
yet still obligates families to serve the community otherwise. 
Adopted defenders and unofficial militia offer pathways for merit to gain honor, 
blending hereditary stability with fresh talent and redemption.

Aegon: Interesting—but how do you integrate outsiders 
or immigrants into your strict lineage-bound militia?

Euchi: Immigrants enter as unofficial militia, publicly serving, 
visible in their deeds recorded on the One Ring. 
Honor achieved in unofficial service allows sponsorship into official roles. 
Through sacrifice and service, strangers become family, 
gaining the community’s trust and eventual lineage standing.

Orac Scit: What of disputes, Euchi? Humans err, misunderstand, and clash. 
Who judges controversies when militia power itself is contested?

Euchi: National jury assemblies peer-to-peer, their judgments recorded openly, 
weighted with wisdom, overseen by community consensus. 
Errors and corruption are separated distinctly; the higher the trust, the harsher the penalty for corruption.

Aegon: Still, I sense imbalance
—your militia focuses inward, but how then manage external policy and threats beyond local sight?

Euchi: Vikings alone bear offensive warfare, voluntary yet disciplined, 
sized proportionately to not weaken home defense. 
G alone sets policy but without military power, 
ensuring the nation’s will, not personal ambition, guides offensive action.

Orac Scit: Yet might not these Vikings, gaining wealth and power abroad, return as threats themselves?

Euchi: Wealth from Viking ventures is publicly accounted and distributed transparently; 
dishonor forfeits their claim openly by majority vote. 
They cannot surpass the power or size of home militias. 
Viking deeds, honorable or shameful, are permanent.

Aegon: Euchi, you propose that the highest respected members of the community are militia. 
Can martial virtue alone sustain a just society?

Euchi: Martial virtue grounds security, but civic virtue is cultivated lifelong, 
families devoted fully, as education integrates virtue, civic honor, and discipline from youth onward. Martial strength is matched by ethical maturity.

Orac Scit: Euchi, you weave strength, accountability, and virtue together in militia and viking form. 
Yet remain watchful: strength may turn prideful, accountability mechanical, 
and virtue superficial without humility and wisdom.

Euchi: Humility guides all strength, self-knowledge guards virtue, 
and the One Ring illuminates accountability transparently. 
Thus liberty remains vibrant, continually self-renewed.

Aegon: Euchi, your system holds remarkable promise, 
yet let vigilance guard against human nature’s shadows. 
Freedom forever balances upon the sharpest edge.

Euchi: Only through perpetual diligence, transparency, and virtue may we maintain liberty’s fine balance.

Orac Scit: Thus may the nation thrive, aware of its limitations, nurturing virtue alongside vigilance, strength tempered by wisdom, freedom protected by eternal diligence.


Dialogue
Mathematics quantify valuable metals as a being of infinite nature.
Continuous mining of metals is compounded by unknown quantities stored or waiting to be rediscovered. 
Any currency founded upon precious metals is susceptible to overnight implosion.

Fiat currency is built entirely upon widespread trust in set imaginary value.
In no era of human history has fiat been a stable foundation for a society.
History has proven that countries attack the stability of other nations by devaluation of currency and then using stability of their own currency to leverage a foothold which then acts as a permanent threat of explosion.

Anti-inflationary nature of Land Money gives high value to 10% returns of common stock. 
{ no taxes, no fees, no devaluation by inflation, finite resource, external assess, no monopoly }


A sold B, common stock A increased by 20% in cycle, B traded with a gain. 
Next cycle, the common stock of A is in greater demand. His portfolio shows a the next cycle will complete major improvements. He adds 30% to the cycle-valuation due from matrix. Buyers know they are at a risk of 130%-110% = 20%. The calculated gains are likely to increase the value to 140%. Common stock with an upward trend are more solvent.
The final buy-back gain of 10% benefits the stock with liquidity as a final likelihood.

A fire devalued the land to 30%. The owner knows he can modify the land to be more fire-resistant and improve the land. Else the land will be lost. Exists a strong incentive to buy the land back at 110% of the original value.
Thus the stock holders do not lose the value. They gain 10% from insolvent stock, of their original.


Dialogue: Land Money

Euchi:
Let us begin with the root: What is it that makes a currency worthy of trust? 
The ancients worshipped gold and silver, for their shine was eternal, 
but their worth, it seems, is haunted by infinity. 
There is always one more mountain to scour, one shipwreck yet unfound.

Orac Scit:
And thus, Master, we have seen gold-backed empires fall 
when a new mine was struck, or a horde revealed. 
The value of the coin diluted overnight, not by honest labor, but by fortune and greed.

Euchi:
Fiat then arose—not from the earth, but from consensus. 
“This paper has worth because we say it does, and our sword is sharp.” 
But fiat is a shadow without a body, easily dispelled by the winds of war, 
the whim of kings, or the whisper of panic. 
Trust, when shaken, is not easily restored.

Orac Scit:
Indeed, all fiat money is a bet against disaster. 
And history is a record of lost wagers: nations attacking the purse of their rivals, 
devaluation as the hidden blade, and the common folk left with ashes.

Euchi:
Now attend: Land, unlike gold or decree, is a finite vessel, a substance shared by all. 
It cannot be conjured, nor can it slip away in the night. 
Each parcel, seen by the sun, bounded by stone and tree, 
is a currency which resists both the pickaxe and the printing press.

Orac Scit:
And yet, land is not without its own perils. 
What of fire, flood, and the decay of empires? 
Is not land devalued by disaster, or lost by misrule?

Euchi:
This is the heart of the matter. Land money is not static; it is cyclic, like the seasons. 
Through the cycle, the value of land—made liquid as common stock—rises and falls with fortune. 
But at each cycle’s end, all claims converge: the holder is redeemed at 110% of the original value. 
The risk and gain are known in advance; no one is left in ruin by surprise, nor enriched by chance alone.

Orac Scit:
So, let us examine:
Suppose A sells common stock to B. 
In the course of the cycle, improvements and public works raise the value by 20%. 
B sells to C for a profit. All are content. 
In the next cycle, more improvements are foreseen, and the matrix reflects this. 
Buyers see an opportunity—a further 30% rise is possible. 
But the limit is set by the cycle: the maximum return is known.
Thus, speculation is productive, not reckless.

Euchi:
Exactly. And if calamity strikes—a fire burns the land to ash, its value cut to a third
—the owner still has the motive and means to restore it. 
He may rebuild, make the land fire-resistant, and recover both value and standing. 
The cycle is a net, catching the fall, giving time for recovery.
At worst, the wildlife gains and all animals therein bless the 'unfortunate stockholder' 
At low likelihood, the stockholder receives the same redemption as was paid; 
At best, both owner and holder prosper from honest effort.

Orac Scit:
This, then, is the difference:
	Gold can be diluted.
	Fiat can be devalued.
	Land, by its cycles and bounds, is shielded from both.
No monopoly can seize the earth, for the public and wild claim all loss. 
No inflation gnaws at the value, for all see and verify the land’s worth.

Euchi:
And so, with land as money, the people are not at the mercy of distant kings or hidden mines, 
but of their own labor and stewardship.
The cycle is the proof against both panic and pride.
The return is slow, sure, and anchored to reality.
This is no fantasy—it is the currency of a living nation.
Dialogue: Education & Meritocracy
ORAC SCIT 

Euchi: We discuss the very heart of society—education and the merit by which men rise or fall. 
Our doctrine demands an education liberated from all barriers, 
where merit alone governs the ascent of the individual.

Kleon: Noble indeed, Euchi, yet history mocks idealism. 
Was it not Plato himself who dreamed of philosopher-kings educated by merit, 
only to find each generation slipping again into corruption?

Euchi: True, Kleon, yet the flaw of history was always hidden privilege
—gatekeepers in schools, subtle bribes, unseen favors. 
We propose a new meritocracy, utterly transparent and public.

Thalion: Transparency alone does not erase bias, Euchi. 
In ancient China, scholars competed openly, yet families with gold hired tutors who knew the codes, tilting the scales invisibly.

Kleon: Precisely. Even the ancient Greeks suffered the same
—wealthy Athenians could buy the rhetoric teachers, thus commanding the public debates.

Euchi: Indeed, the past warns us. But here is our difference: we abolish the hidden pathways. 
Every ordeal, duel, and test is public, the results immutable and recorded openly by AI. 
Rich and poor stand side-by-side, with AI ensuring skill, not style, triumphs.

Thalion: And who ensures this AI remains neutral? 
Every mechanism built by men may be twisted by men.

Euchi: Our law demands all AI processes remain documented, transparent, and reviewable by any citizen. No blackbox system can stand.

Kleon: Your ideal is grand, but consider children
—who protects them from either neglect or excessive ambition? 
How do we balance freedom and responsibility?

Euchi: We grant guardianship explicitly to the community. 
Every adult shares in cultivating the child; 
no community reputation can thrive beyond the measure of its least-favored child.

Thalion: Such community accountability is noble. Yet consider: 
will not local prejudices smother unusual genius? 
Will communities not favor conformists and pleasant mediocrity?

Euchi: Therefore we spread accountability
—community, regional, national, global competitions, 
each curated by distinct cultures and AI impartiality. 
Genius thus finds multiple paths, not limited by local blindness.

Kleon: Yet again, we stumble on a familiar rock—judgment itself. 
Who judges merit fairly, without bias or agenda?

Euchi: Public ordeal, Kleon! Public debates, public duels—openly judged by all. 
AI metrics balanced by human witness. 
Reputation forged in open fire, not private whispers.

Thalion: A brilliant ordeal can dazzle the crowd, yet be shallow underneath. 
History knows this tale—the sophists of Athens, masters of flash over substance.

Euchi: Correct, and therefore each ordeal must test depth. 
Construction marathons, extended discourse, multi-stage evaluations
—flash is tested by sustained performance. 
Even the most cunning sophist stumbles over time.

Kleon: But Euchi, every society eventually creates its own aristocracy. 
Wealth, power, intelligence—all gather into dynasties.

Euchi: Which is why our doctrine explicitly mandates constant upheaval 
through public duels, challenges, and ordeals.
 None may rest complacently atop old victories.

Thalion: And still, history’s ghosts whisper that every meritocracy yet devised has decayed, 
strangled by subtle privilege.

ORAC SCIT: Meritocracy is as water—it seeks always the lowest path. 
Yet, even water reshapes mountains, given time. 
No human system is impervious to corruption, 
yet corruption’s strength lies in shadow, secrecy, and silence.

Make your meritocracy public, transparent, and ever-renewing. 
Make privilege visible; make manipulation impossible to conceal. 
Ensure no single gatekeeper, no single judge. 
Harness AI for impartiality, yet trust the human heart to spot injustice. 
Create ordeals that test truth deeply and openly, again and again.

Yet remember, even then, some genius will be cast aside. 
No system saves every Van Gogh, every Socrates. 
The mark of a true civilization is not that it never fails genius
—but that it leaves a door open to its redemption, even after rejection.

In transparency, accountability, and humility, your doctrine may yet reshape mountains.

Euchi: Then let our meritocracy stand not on the promise of perfection, but on constant vigilance. 
Let honor rest not in status earned once, but in excellence proven anew, day after day.
Dialogue: Owner Employee Investor
ORAC SCIT

Kleon: But Euchi, why do you disallow partnerships and corporations,
Structures commonly employed in our time?

Euchi: History speaks clearly, Kleon. 
Modular discrete companies, each guided by a responsible individual, 
succeed profoundly where conglomerates falter. 
Unix, Perl—these were not borne by committees but by dedicated masters. 
Conglomerates breed corruption, inefficiency, and secrecy, rather than innovation.

Kleon: Yet large undertakings demand collective effort. 
How can this be reconciled?

Euchi: Great ventures must rely upon modularization, 
numerous independent companies each accountable and transparent. 
Citizen marshals, independently assigned by One Ring, guard the integrity of these massive enterprises.

Thalion: Yet consider, Euchi, if singular ownership restricts expertise and innovation
—how will enterprises requiring multiple specialists flourish without partnerships?

Euchi: Modular structures, each led by accountable individuals, 
allow specialization without sacrificing accountability. 
The collaborative strength lies not in conglomeration but in transparent modular alliances.

Kleon: Your commitment to public transparency is admirable, 
yet may it not compromise competitive advantage and privacy?

Euchi: Transparency guards integrity and builds trust. 
Sensitive information remains accessible only to citizen marshals, 
ensuring accountability without unnecessary exposure.

Thalion: Your employment metrics intrigue me
—but do they not risk reducing complex human contributions to mere calculable units?

Euchi: A valid concern, Thalion. 
Yet, consider metrics as guides rather than absolute measures. 
Peer reviews and management oversight on One Ring maintain fairness, 
rewarding genuine contribution beyond mere hours logged.

Kleon: Euchi, Your principle of single accountable ownership intrigues me, 
but how will you address unforeseen incompetence or lack of preparedness in an heir?

Euchi: Kleon, lineage alone does not define suitability. 
Heirship may extend beyond blood through adoption
—merit, proven virtue, and capability shall govern the choice, echoing ancient wisdom.

Kleon: Euchi, the role of passive investors appears restricted and unattractive. 
Might this discourage essential capital investment?

Euchi: Passive investors recognize that effort precedes reward. 
Their role, carefully balanced, ensures they contribute without undue influence. 
The community debt serves as a safeguard,
 acknowledging the investor’s trust yet reminding us of our initial obligations.

Thalion: And your rule against fractional reserves
—do you not fear that strict adherence might limit economic flexibility?

Euchi: Prudence demands that tangible, immediate commitment underlies investment. 
While flexibility is valuable, the integrity and stability derived from full, 
immediate investment create a safer long-term economic environment.

Kleon: Lastly, resource extraction
—local oversight seems sound, but might it not breed local corruption or narrow self-interest?

Euchi: National oversight of multiplier standards ensures impartiality. 
Citizen marshals, allocated by the independent One Ring, 
balance local interests with broader ecological and social integrity.

Thalion: These points clarify much, Euchi. 
Your vision requires delicate balance and continued vigilance.

Euchi: Indeed, friends. No system is beyond refinement. 
Continued discourse is essential, illuminating our blind spots and strengthening our community bonds.


Dialogue: On the Doctrine of Man Meat
ORAC SCIT

Euchi: Friends, today let us examine the doctrine of “Man Meat.” 
The core is this: society respects all life or respects none. 
A murderer who takes innocent life violates the foundation of order and thus forfeits his own. 
His execution serves justice absolutely, and in death, returns balance by nourishing the animal kingdom. Is this doctrine wise and just?

Kleon: Euchi, you propose execution without mercy or rehabilitation for murderers. 
Yet does this not assume infallibility in judgment? 
How can society guard against wrongful executions?

Euchi: A vital concern, Kleon. This is precisely why execution must be public, visible, and visceral. 
When all eyes bear witness, the officials responsible face maximum accountability. 
The fear of misjudgment thus ensures justice is measured and meticulous.

Thalion: Yet, Euchi, I fear you tread a path of profound brutality. 
Is not mercy, forgiveness, and the possibility of redemption the hallmark of a truly civilized society? 
Does your doctrine not risk reducing justice to mere vengeance?

Euchi: Your concern is noble, Thalion, but misplaced. 
True mercy draws clear lines. 
Lesser offenses may indeed seek redemption and rehabilitation. 
Murder, however, is an irrevocable act—a point of no return. 
Forgiveness here is not mercy but an abdication of justice, 
serving only the greed of institutions that profit from punishment rather than resolve crime.

Kleon: Even accepting this, Euchi, the notion of human bodies as “meat” for animals troubles me deeply. Does this not strip the human corpse of dignity and sacredness, descending into barbarity?

Euchi: Quite the opposite, Kleon. 
Your notion of human exceptionalism is itself barbaric. 
The civilized intellect recognizes the dignity and interconnectedness of all life. 
To return human flesh to animals is not desecration but restoration, 
repaying our debt to the animal kingdom from which humanity continually takes. 
In this balance, dignity resides not in hoarding our bodies but in harmonizing with the universe.

Thalion: Euchi, you speak of cosmic balance, 
yet does this practice not risk a society desensitized to violence, 
numb to the spectacle of public execution?

Euchi: The execution is neither spectacle nor entertainment, Thalion. 
It is solemn, necessary accountability. 
Public transparency prevents conspiracies and injustices hidden behind closed doors. 
The horror witnessed in such acts mirrors precisely the gravity of the original crime. 
To sanitize death is to diminish the gravity of murder itself.

Kleon: But Euchi, do you not fear misuse by powerful actors 
who might exploit this doctrine under the guise of justice?

Euchi: Vigilance must always accompany any powerful doctrine. 
Public oversight, stringent criteria, and absolute equality before the law
—whether vagrant or king
—are safeguards woven into the very fabric of this doctrine. 
The same standard of ultimate justice applies to all.

Euchi: Your challenges sharpen this vision, friends. 
Indeed, justice is not static—it demands constant refinement and vigilance. 
Let us revisit and refine our doctrine continually, 
ensuring that our quest for cosmic balance and absolute justice remains true.

Kleon & Thalion: So it must be, Euchi. 
Dialogue is our greatest safeguard. We shall revisit this again.
