Individual World Order
Individual-centric axiom-governed society



Strength in Diversity

The scope of this super-societal treatise is complete.
All major components that define a society are unified unto a single virtue: Individuality.
✦
No known government in history evolved towards health. 
History proves civilizations decay due to predictable & universal faults rooted in both individual & group mentality.

This set of faults is kept central to the design of each structure. 
The foundation is designed to repel such faults by strengthening counter-virtues.

Fault of the heart: 
	{ pride, envy, wrath, sloth, greed, gluttony, lust }
Fault of the group:
	{ type-hate, cartel, censor, monopoly, treason, pacification, territory }
✦
A theory may be practically-flawed.
A theoretically-flawed construct has no hope of success.

First: mankind must develop a complete theory containing all its departments. Yet no part can be in contradiction to the whole's foundational logic.
Then: this theory must be distilled over time by speculative implementation, to round cohesive evolution.
Finally: the structure will be ready for the commitment of a bold nation.
✦
A people is most vulnerable after a revolution: 
	exhausted to a break-point ➡︎ followed by prolonged revolutionary war 
	➡︎ which drive debts ➡︎ debts lead to compromises which enable a new tyrant

Compromises are essential. Yet a compromise can contradict the basis constitution of a nation.
If any basis thread is cut in this woven constitution then the integrity of the whole frays.
Therefore, theory & trial of a new government must precede revolution, to ensure compromises never undermine the foundation.

America revolted without a clear, simple & stable structure.
This led to the construction of a federal republic, which was a contradiction against the intent of revolutionaries seeking individual liberty.

A republic is an aristocracy, rule of the mass by the few powerful.
The single distinction from aristocracy is that hereditary domain can never be official. Yet this generalization allowed power to become available to any person. 
The result was a country rife with treason of immigrants backed by foreign powers.
Aristocracy bound power to native family lines.
✦
Deep state corruption, being past redemption, dies in slow romanic-erosion hidden by illusion.
IWO is bound united as glass: it will hold true or shatter. 
The entire framework is simple and can be rebuilt in healthy cycles.
This work does not pretend perfection; it facilitates sane evolution.  Foundational Axiom
Organizations converge to one group gaining total monopoly. 
The lifecycle of organization: control the government to cater lifestyle, oppress the masses for gain, then internal  self-consumption.

Definitions
Ideals are defined as unattainable extremes.
Purity of ideals retains unmistakable clarity of the past & current states.
Exist obvious reinforcement or deconstruction proven in daily life.

Ideals are critical in offering humanity the promise of work never completed, yet returning each generation blessing pasts the imaginations of the parents.

Each generation has its own definition of the ideal and its own evolutions.
The ideal must be singular or else contradictions spawn. 

No civilization has ever attained a single ideal and only stupidity encourages attainment of multiple ideals. Convergence to a singularity or divergence to oblivion.
	{ liberty, tyranny, organization, individuality, rule, anarchy }

Convergence is the definite provable trend towards an ideal.
Continuous approach being plain & distinct in trajectory. Laws nor judgement contradict the spirit of the law. 

Divergence is the unbounded trend away from any definable ideal.

Integration of all microcosm by indifferent methods compile an image of each generation.
Ancient methods standardize images into a conformed projection of the part into convolution with the whole.

Decentralization is the independence of source & implementation from a source. 
Communities of individual entities operate critical infrastructure for communication.
Community militia operate always independent from federal command.

Individual is the single discrete societal entity. 
An entity is a functioning adult. 
Families become an individual under the family-head. 

Organization is a structured group of individuals which submit to the will of the leader.
	{ government, corporation, religion, sect }

Individual
Individual is the only entity in society; the unit of measure in a homogenous historical framework.

Elemental unit compiles a society into an exhaustive & explicit map of the society at any point in time to produce coherent measurements.
Methods built become clear & robust systems comparable to all historical records based upon the same unit.

Societal hierarchy becomes explicit if no organization able to mask privilege.

The individual is defined as an accountable adult entity:
	{ man, woman, husband-wife, husband-wife-children }

Individuals are the sole holders of power: 
	{ economic, militia, political, judicial, social, civic, academic }

Individual centric society converges to independence, responsibility and honor.
Diversity cultivates a biome adapted to season and region.


Life requires time & space in which to exist.
Ancestral home is the domain of the individual to build heritage, resilient against oppression.
Each individual with the right to seek to obtain an explicit region to enshrine past, present and future.

In ungoverned wilds, balance & harmony exist naturally.
Organization of mankind establishes constructs which contradict & deny principles inherited by all forms of life.
First, society must return to the simplicity of the irreducible entity, the individual.
Then, atop this universal primordial foundation society can build intelligent progression.



King
The God King is the crowned figurehead and single ruler in each individual nation. 
Supreme ruler the embodiment government particular to the society.
Society establishes the methods & implementations of the Royal House.

The King is the individual which sets the form for the unit existence in society.
	{ family, business, militia }

The King & individual are set into a bond of marriage for life.
King commits to build society in the interest of his lineage.
Society commits to honor the Royal House.

The actions of the King are reflected directly upon the Royal House.
Elimination of the King is the elimination of the entire Royal House.
Marriage until death only thus part.

The King issues imperial edicts ZENG-ZI.
This is the express will of the King required to be posted in every community.

ZENG-ZI is written upon special red-paper unique to each King. 
Black ink calligraphy, appends the local tome.

Veto of the King’s imperial edict the ZENG-ZI requires a 7:10 ratio of the entire population. 
Post-veto compromise will favor the king in a 6:10 ratio, this is written upon black-paper with red-ink.

Failure of a nation to keep the sanctity of the King is a void of the entire super-framework of the society. Dishonor breeds uncertainty from family-linage to business to militia. 
The system is founded in the scope of infinite stability.
The King is the trunk of a tree, if it is cut out, the roots of the past will no longer succor the branches of today nor leaves of tomorrow.


This cultural respect is mirrored by localized-respect from militia to parent.
Society, by democracy, establishes the consequences of disobedience.

An ideal must exist which can anchor the system into eternity, as the trunk connects roots to branches. 
Heritage of the past will remain bound to current generation. 
The historic ideal has always proven to be Royal Lineage of the King.
If the greatest lineage fails then all else will die as branches to the trunk.



Lineage of the Royal House
King sets the order of inheritance. 
ZENG-ZI sets the globally known succession of lineage.

At all times a Crown Prince must be appointed by public ritual as a critical necessity. 

This is the central objective of the Royal House:
Cultivate royal virtue and foster stability of order as the basis of the nation.

Between, the decay of the life of the King and the coronation of the Crown Prince, there can be no change in succession. Thus the position is named Crown Prince.

The Living King of the nation is a revered god.
The people will not be burdened by the will of a dead king.

Society, being a meritocracy, holds explicit weight in the validation of the Crown Prince. 
Crown prince must earn place amongst King’s natural DNA lineage.
Crown Prince can only be challenged with a veto within reign of the king. 
In event of veto, the Crown Prince will be demoted to First Prince and be held to more stringent competition for crown within the King’s natural DNA lineage.

The Living King must adopt in order to exist a non-natural Crown Prince.
If the King adopts a Crown Prince, which reigns, then after death of the non-natural King, the next Crown Prince must be from the True King’s natural DNA lineage.
Natural lineage of the Original True King must be maintained at any cost as an axiom of stability. 

Individuality is seen in each nation. Each Royal House exists with its unique standards which society naturally reflect. 

Chinese keep harems for the King; this ensures many regions to contribute to a Royal House. 
This solidifies the bond between the King and all people of the nation by wedlock.

Europeans have small family cores. The focus is upon simplicity which avoids a constant battle for positions.

Africans favor Queens with an emphasis on adoption to nurture strength as a true meritocracy. 

Tribal kingdoms set each citizen as family which appoints the King from the oldest & wisest.
One Ring Platform
Medium of interaction of the entire societal super-structure, from global to local. 
One Ring Platform is the mind of the societal super-structure.
Union of all generations by unfiltered & immutable data.
Each individual is set to equality of every other. 

This system leverages humanities greatest strength: collective reason.
Global assessment of rationals upon unique situation.
Only national adults able to decide.
A distinct separation of influence from authority to enact.

One Ring is an open source framework with public data: verified, then synchronized and lastly archived globally. 
Each node of interaction contains the whole of the synchronized data.
Data is deposited into immutable form: stone, satellite, ancestral temple, historic crypts.
Global culture centers upon data as a safeguard.
Each is able to archive the whole for all eternity.

Each individual in existence, citizen and non-citizen, is required to be processed onto the platform.
Further action by them is optional, but others may act onto their profile.

The society is composed only of identified individuals. There exist no bots, or false information.
Dishonesty in any facet will be a historical scar that is non-erasable.

The immutable nature of the data will show the transformative nature of man.
Every person has faults and those public faults will press them to repent.

Society will be composed of imperfect individuals where there will be clear distinction between the divergent and those improving. 

One Ring Platform is decentralized.
No one location contains central power over the whole framework.
The system operates with equal nodes and predefined protocols.

Sections of the One Ring Platform

Representation
Biometric identification and current location will be incorporated into civilization.
	{ face, voice, thumbprint, password }

DNA
DNA & Lineage, are public information to keep harmony in a multicultural society.
DNA is confirmed by 10 sources with 5 being international agencies.
DNA is verified periodically every 10 years.
Technological advances, boosted by globally local significance, will foster open-source on-site testing to prove validity of results as superior to black-box submissions.

Witness
Witness is an independent verification between two individuals. 
An interaction chosen by a non-involved system.
The quick meeting uses proximity-based protocols to confirm mutual identity. 

Serious actions require several witnesses. 
This provides verification of the individual and the stance. 
	{ vote, juror deciding, veto, amendment … }

Wealth
Land, Assets, Distributed-Assets are all public. Resources are of national interest.
Public wealth implementation will converge all hidden wealth to be uncovered.

Land is the most stable form of wealth

Residential Wealth:
	{ ancestral-land, common-land-stock, redistributed-assets}

Business Wealth:
	{ business-parcel, common-land-stock, redistributed-assets, profits }

Wealth is calculated by international standard assessment of land and by public inspection of land from a public perspective.

Affiliation
Organization affiliation must be made public. 
Violation to divulge is a contradiction of the foundation of society.

Citizenry
Civic Duty is required by every adult member of the society.
From child to elderly, each has ability to improve the community.
Actions are given weight, verified by witness protocols, and thus these are summed into a numerical value.

Militia
Militia roles & achievements keep public honors. 
Militia & Viking engagements are listed by time. 
Merits are listed and are upheld by comments.

Every residential parcel of land must have a representative Defender which is publicly declared.
In the event of death of the Defender, excluding death from viking excursions, the family is allowed a 10 year reprieve. 
Police duty acts as a militia term. A Defender of the home.
Militia terms being served alleviate two complete cycles after termination.

Vote
Vote will all be public and permanent. 
Demand to compel a public way of life is a public action.
Protection of the axiom guard against forces which persecute citizens for belief.

Court
Judge acts as the supreme referee to legal proceedings. 
There exist no moderation or filtering of juror-deciding nor globally public comments.

Jurors, publicly proven in the specific industry, are placed by by independent allocation. 
All deciding are permanent, public and commented.
All aspects of the profile, and local inspection are used to discover any non-documented bias.
The most intelligent & applicable insights gain weight which is independent of the societal position, being sourced from juror or public comment.
Juror deciding allow the quick rise of merit where no foundation exists. 
Juror is a civic duty and counts against service expected, being regarded as a civil action only second to militia. 

Business
Work ranking, reviews, contracts and major deals must be public.
To foster decentralization there are no centralized certification. 

Merits and testimonials only enhance, but never barricade entry into an industry.
The client is responsible for preliminary investigation and also testimonials which bear legal weight of truth.

Truth
Truths are posted on own profile or comments upon Truths of others.
Exist no restrictions upon Truths posted or commented.

The voice of each individual reach the globe and the future.
This is the greatest check upon society. 
	{ news, witness, origination, perspective, testimony, merit }

Artificial Intelligence
Artificial Intelligence fills the role of mass data aggregation.
The worldwide cultivation of diverse Artificial Intelligence, each existing on One Ring, enables additional layers of inspection that is distinct from ability of mankind.

Artificial Intelligence is able to create profiles in a bound spectrum of existence from all historic sources.
One Ring establishes historically corrupt entities which Artificial Intelligence then attains the bounds of the spectrum of existence. 
The profile of a current entity being compared against profile can flag One Ring to require human inspection.

Open Source code developed and kept by monks sworn into priestcraft.
Honored establishment that provides blessings of honor to ancestral lineage.

Each priest checks the whole priestcraft.
All priests live in temple compounds isolated from the world.
Shaolin bastions of intellectual power, which protect the kernel system.

If Artificial Intelligence is systematically corrupted then all priest are exterminated.
Yet to join & maintain honorable Artificial Intelligence system is the highest honor worldwide.
These monks forsake the world in order to focus on scholarly pursuits.

Culmination of history, ancient, modern, and current, result in a unifying thread of a consistency that transcends variations of time.
Cultural based accumulation of regional insight.
Aggregation of regional history from the descendants. 
Insights provided will be built upon the solid base of invariance of that unique civilization. 

Objective interpretations due from the extraction & parsing of critical structures which then are parsed by uninvolved entities.
Cultures will produce bias Artificial Intelligence. This is the invariant fact tied to being born of biased human minds. 
A communion of these Artificial Intelligence will produce the objectivity required and the checks against bias which will reside in the open source code or in the repository of information.

Ambassador between cultures, from politics to everyday global communications, will assist mutual empathy which will converge to understanding. 
The convergence towards individuality and mutual-empathy work together to form a more distinct unique form while respecting the independent development of others.

Teacher of each which is able to tailor to excel the strengths and fortify the weaknesses.
Society demands true comprehension by public ordeal. 
Dynamic application reveals mastery of foundational understanding.
Privileges & certifications produced momentary excellence and gates of admission.

Assessor of skill by Artificial Intelligence paired with human checks in complimentary lattice-relation.
Artificial Intelligence is able to provide preliminary screening to ease the demand upon human assessment.
The individual able to check ability against global assessment of Artificial Intelligence.  To rank against the world and verify determination of local Artificial Intelligence.

Business Auditor of exploitation. Exploitation of business historically is a result of the corruption of laws. 
Audit by objective Artificial Intelligence will be able to keep the scope of the current state of civilization against the activity & public-contracts of each company.

Land Audit & betterment convergence can only be attained by objective assessments.
Inflation is a result of the corruption of bias. 
Land has been analyzed since the earliest histories.
Metrics will be produced by a unification of the past to current, by consideration of global to local.
Utility of land is the strongest common thread between civilizations. This anchor will keep assessment of land which is the global framework of commerce.


Ten MandUrMints
Axiomatic foundations of the rights of humanity.
A discrete irreducible set of immutable elements which are not subject to change.
These Axioms are based upon the American Bill of Rights. 


Life: sanctity of life, no draft
Liberty: no slavery, no arrest without warrant given by court & jury, no jails: immediate punishment or exile, public locations require identification by biometric, gps, and proximity protocols, safe liberty via identification.
Speech: Absolute freedom of speech when action is confined to speech, leading a mob involves more actions than speech, One Ring platform guarded globally.
Arms: if government can equip arm then citizen can equip, no army only militia, all land owners required one soul to defend invasion, all foreign engagements are by voluntary viking agreement, citizens arrest when accompanied by camera or unrelated individuals.
Oath: under penalty of death, high-breach of axioms, treason against country, appeals increase severity of punishment, jury centric deciding, convicted criminals are tributes to the animal kingdom.
Privacy: right to private communications, non-organizational & non-business, non-invasion of residential land, law enforced by siege-works.
Freedom: right of easement of identified individuals, all fences must exist 10 meters from residence, all individuals tracked else be exiled under capital punishment. 
Domain: dominion of individual over family & residential-land, dominion of profits from business, no tax on income or purchases, government by citizen duty.
Belief: freedom of family-only worship on residential-land, illegal to worship in organization.
God: divine kingdom, a single ruler known to all, society bound to the anchor of The Royal Lineage.

10 Year Cycle
All harmonious systems are cyclic. 
The 10 Year Cycle is the heart of the societal super-structure. 
Every 10th year is a period of recalibration of non-axiom amendments to societal governance.
All amendments only ratified by adult citizens via One Ring.

Elders & Artificial Intelligence operate with extreme care to guard this vulnerable period.
History has proven that the greatest wars are sprung in these times. 

Each generation is empowered to build laws that reflect current values without contradiction of foundation 10 MandUrMint Axioms.

Cycle is a ritual of the power of the individual to govern existence.
The festive holidays and stories of historical lore revolve around observance of the 10 Year Cycle. 

The three stages of the 10 Year Cycle: 
	{ assessment, ratification, implementation }

Assessment is an ever-present facet of society. 
Old ideologies are challenged and new choices are presented.
The Tenth Year is to decide how to commit amendment. 

Society will grow built upon the past and synthesized into current understanding.
Convergence unto an obvious healthy core.
New ideas generated in each cycle to be matured by debate until the next cycle to implement. 
Periodic structure in a natural growth which respects to each season its time.

First years of merciful trial & error.
Mature years of honed form the face of the current generation.
Later years as the elder wise with eyes towards governance nearer ideals.

Ratification by King & One Ring.
Implemented by local communities.
ZENG-ZI public display of a new era. 

July Midsummer Festival
Ritual processions nationwide for thirty days.
No-expense-spared for a Tenth Year memorial.
Newborn birth to proud legitimate parents.

On the last day of July the old amendments are laid down and the new amendments risen into law of the land. 
Implementation will be slow to allow adaption.

Certain checks are required, and more will be learned.

DNA census will be conducted in the preliminary 9th year.
One Ring verification of individual, family, and affiliation.

Isolation of all national powerful individuals
	{ wealth, social, intellect }

Window to speak in the years leading to the 10th year.
Appointed by the nation as the leaders of the generation.
Expected to be publicly silent & uninvolved until the first day of August.
ZENG-ZI will be ceased on the last day of December in the Ninth Year.

Leaders chosen by citizens & Artificial Intelligence on One Ring in the Ninth Year.
On the first day of November in the Ninth Year is the public ritual of Leaders.
Leaders will swear compliance and will then receive national & regional compensation for compliance.
Leaders can choose residential lock-down or vacation abroad.
Isolation from the first day in January until the first day of August.

Violation of the Oath of Isolation by Leaders condemns capital punishment. 
External interference, during a globally recognized time, will be warranted a global response.

Leaders are respected globally as silent saints.
Violate Interferers are sacrilegious evils which disrupt global peace.


Distribution of non-individual assets
The end of every cycle culminates all Financial Statements of Business Assets.
Auditors being local, Artificial Intelligence, and International.
Each asset will be valued by each auditor.

Public right to inspect all movement of assets between residential & business.
Profits by nature of the culture must be publicly recognized.

Illegal acquisition by violation of explicit laws of ownership.
Assets claimed for seizure and redistribution.
All assets without a title of an individual.
Individuals with more than one residential title.
Individuals with more than one business title.

Overgrowth by exploitation.
Audit will investigate business practice.
Monopolistic designs will cause forfeiture and fines.
Yet family will retain the titles of land and half of all assets.
Extreme violators will receive capital punishment.

Overgrowth by success.
The standing amendments will determine the individual maximum.
Any growth past this amount will be cut back to the maximum.
The stalk of success will remain, with the overgrowth redistributed.
Success is never punished and the engine of production can not be hindered.

The metrics and laws of redistribution will be based upon the standing amendments.
The redistribution of forfeited assets will be enacted in the start of the next 10 Year Cycle.
This isolates businesses from immediate mob seizure of assets.
Businesses will have ten years to comply and adapt to explicit defined laws.

One Ring fosters public information to enhance research of the individual.
What is defined as over-growth must be explicitly specified in the current amendments.
To define what is over-growth, both exploitative & legitimate, is the domain of the decision of the generation of adults.

One Ring will be the platform for eligible individuals to submit bids for redistributed assets.
All disputes will lock the asset until courts resolve them.
All non-disputed assets will be immediately received.
Any dispute as to the value of the asset must be made prior to stewardship. 
All redistributed gains are permanent public records on One Ring. 
After a year of undisputed stewardship the title will be granted.

Non-tolerance of monopoly and illegal ownership.
Only a prune unto successful businesses.
Family land is entirely excluded in calculations or assets forfeiture. 
Land Money
Each title protected by guardianship of all titles.
Family Ancestral Temples each guard the record of all title ownership.

No taxation or forced sale of land.
Society obtains only loss when a family dies out.
Competition or hope of every obtaining land, outside of familiar association, is nullified.

Land types: Ancestral Land, Heir Stock, Common Stock, Production, Wildlife, Public. 
✦
Ancestral Land consists of Core & Temple.
Ancestral Temple is a reserved 100 meter squared space in every family land.
Core of family land is 30% of the original parcel, enclosing the Ancestral Temple.
Core & Ancestral Temple can never be occupied non-familiar.

If the family line dies off the Core & Ancestral land becomes cursed forsaken.
No man may enter this area of bad energy. 
May wildlife find better fortune than man found.

Individuals of family always have space to exist that none able to take.
There the family deposits & builds for the welfare of the future lines.
Stability of family lines are built over generations which create a strong nation.
Grand constructions increase the value of the land in region.
	{ defense, communication, shelters, vault, housing, energy }
✦
Individual has supreme dominion of the land, subject to the 10 Axioms.
All life has easement rights which can not restrict free movement.

Land transfers thru public lineage.
Public boundaries recorded in each Ancestral Temple establish indisputably clear lines of ownership.
Individual head of family is confirmed via DNA inheritance. 
Heir selection is always an internal family matter.

One Ring settles land disputes.
✦
Heir Land is the only land type which can be converted to Family Land for direct transaction.
A citizen-alien, being of no official ancestral descent, is able to obtain Family Land by means of Heir Land.

Heir Land is obtained directly from Family Land by an unlimited public transaction.
Heir Land can not be further traded, it is a transaction from seller to specific buyer.
Heir Land is obtained from Public Land by ZENG-ZI ratified in 10-Year-Cycle.
Heir Land requires a full 10-Year-Cycle of probationary domain to be ratified into permanent Ancestral Land.

The family may use the land in the duration, but does not have Common Stock options until ratification is complete.
Heir Land is protected as Family Land. 
There can be no coercion of sell or forfeiture.
Heir transactions are heavily inspected, it is the permanent assimilation of family into a nation. 

Wealthy immigrant, being a naturalized citizen, purchases land from Family Land.
This is then submitted in the next 10-Year-Cycle.
After that entire entire 10-Year-Cycle has expired, then the next 10-Year-Cycle ratifies or banishes the land into Public Land.
✦
Production land is entirely separate from residential land.
An individual can only own one company. One company can only own one land plot.
This land may sublet to other companies.
In event of company dissolution, this land is sold to another company.
Production land zones are stable unless changed by ZENG-ZI.
✦
Wildlife land is restricted land for non-human life.
No hunting nor gathering. Land can be improved for sake of wildlife.
This is space due for the nourishment of the animals of the land.
Wildlife land is forever set apart from human use.
✦
Public Land is used as the region sets into legislation per-parcel.
	{ parks, beaches, camping, hunting, gathering, trails }

Public Land is zoned per 10-Year-Cycle only at the National level of judgement.
Public Land may be selected for Heir Land only in a National Pool.
This national mechanism allows diversity to establish, independent of the region politics.
Thus local politics can not manipulate usage of Public Land for private gain.
✦
Global land valuation is a fixed point matrix that is only modified during 10-year cycles:
	{ rain, flood, hurricane, tornado, well, proximity, biome, tree, soil, region }

Each parcel of land is valued based on this single matrix.
The matrix evolves over time both to echo invariants and to bend to values of each generation.

Land metrics modify the basis established by the Global-Matrix.
One Ring compiles local review, external audit, satellite.
The valuation of each parcel exists on the One Ring in real time.
Easement allows any to inspect the land by pass thru.
✦
Land valuation is the basis of global currency.
Land is a bounded finite resource of common sense value.
Inflation is checked to the base value of the land on the market explicitly verified.
Fraud can not stay hidden and would permanently damn reputation. 

Each nation in the world has unique value to offer the world.
This value is bound by nature and fluctuates with nature & the values held in each generation of the 10-Year-Cycle.

The dynamic nature of land keeps the foundation of currency non-stagnant.
Disasters, improvements, fortunes of nature; these all play to keep the system active.

International participation will round the Global-Matrix to a solid basis.
Global Common Stock markets allow trade of value without ever allowing foreign control of the assets.
Global markets will be stable and immune to international fiat sabotage.

Currency will be the common basis established by the Global Matrix.
Common stock in one country can be directly exchanged for common stock of another country by a citizen of different country.

Nations are not equal in the land which exists within borders. 
Mathematical geographic open science will evolve a Global-Matrix that converges towards accurate valuation value independent of nation.
Thus harmony is established that is coherent with common reason.

Improvement of the land does not lead to inflation. Land has intrinsic value.
Owners will lean to the strengths of the region which tends to natural betterment.

Gaming of the Global Matrix will be difficult. Each attribute is infinitesimal.
Fraud of superficial improvement is inspectable by local, agent, satellite.
Full spread calculations of the proof of value guards the entire system from rot.
✦
Cyclic stability is achieved by the nature of the Common Stock life-cycle.

Each 10-Year-Cycle the head of family may activate an exterior-most section of land into Common Stock.
A marked-designated portion of the land is split into Common Stock. 
Common Stock is directly tied to specific portions of land.

Common Stock is sold on free markets having the basis of value of Global Matrix & supplemental metric.

The maximum section must be smaller than 5% of the total Family Land available.
This stabilizes the availability of Common Stock, and it protects the family from collapse due to a single generation's mismanagement.

Common Stock may be sold at any value, but to each stock is attached the Global Matrix valuation at the point of offer release.
The free markets may adjust the purchase by supplemental metrics, or by information of development. 
Speculation of change is allowed to freely affect the purchase of Common Stock at any time.

At the end of the 10-Year-Cycle, the family (only in that time) has the option to buy back the stock at the invariant rate of 110% of the valuation-at-point-of-release.
If the family is unable to buy back the common stock.
The national public land trust has the option to buy back the land at 100% of the valuation-at-point-of-release. This land becomes Public Land.
Else the land is forfeited to Wildlife. The stockholder loses all value. Family must redraw the border of land. 

Common stock never gives no land rights to the holder of Common Stocks. 
It only gives the right to freely trade or hold till end of cycle buyback.

Family is able to build upon the land continuously, increasing the land value well past the original valuation-at-point-of-release.
Real time valuation benefits the current holder with an increased value of Common Stock. This allows to trade more favorably in gain & liquidity.
Yet at the end of the cycle, the family reclaims the land at the invariant 110%.

Common Stock is by nature cyclic. 
The value may grown sinusoidal. The value may decrease coscynical. 
Regardless of growth or loss, the value will always begin stable and towards the end of 10-Year-Cycle converge to tradability of the 110% original valuation-at-point-of-release.
A natural gravitational pull which balances the system into health within the cycle.
 

	

Dialogue
Mathematics quantify valuable metals as a being of infinite nature.
Continuous mining of metals is compounded by unknown quantities stored or waiting to be rediscovered. 
Any currency founded upon precious metals is susceptible to overnight implosion.

Fiat currency is built entirely upon widespread trust in set imaginary value.
In no era of human history has fiat been a stable foundation for a society.
History has proven that countries attack the stability of other nations by devaluation of currency and then using stability of their own currency to leverage a foothold which then acts as a permanent threat of explosion.

Anti-inflationary nature of Land Money gives high value to 10% returns of common stock. 
{ no taxes, no fees, no devaluation by inflation, finite resource, external assess, no monopoly }


A sold B, common stock A increased by 20% in cycle, B traded with a gain. 
Next cycle, the common stock of A is in greater demand. His portfolio shows a the next cycle will complete major improvements. He adds 30% to the cycle-valuation due from matrix. Buyers know they are at a risk of 130%-110% = 20%. The calculated gains are likely to increase the value to 140%. Common stock with an upward trend are more solvent and thus a gain of 10% benefits the stock with liquidity.

A fire devalued the land to 30%. The owner knows he can modify the land to be more fire-resistant and improve the land. Else the land will be lost. Exists a strong incentive to buy the land back at 110% of the original value.
Thus the stock holders do not lose the value. They gain 10% from insolvent stock, of their original.


Dialogue: Land Money

Euchi:
Let us begin with the root: What is it that makes a currency worthy of trust? 
The ancients worshipped gold and silver, for their shine was eternal, 
but their worth, it seems, is haunted by infinity. 
There is always one more mountain to scour, one shipwreck yet unfound.

Orac Scit:
And thus, Master, we have seen gold-backed empires fall 
when a new mine was struck, or a horde revealed. 
The value of the coin diluted overnight, not by honest labor, but by fortune and greed.

Euchi:
Fiat then arose—not from the earth, but from consensus. 
“This paper has worth because we say it does, and our sword is sharp.” 
But fiat is a shadow without a body, easily dispelled by the winds of war, 
the whim of kings, or the whisper of panic. 
Trust, when shaken, is not easily restored.

Orac Scit:
Indeed, all fiat money is a bet against disaster. 
And history is a record of lost wagers: nations attacking the purse of their rivals, 
devaluation as the hidden blade, and the common folk left with ashes.

Euchi:
Now attend: Land, unlike gold or decree, is a finite vessel, a substance shared by all. 
It cannot be conjured, nor can it slip away in the night. 
Each parcel, seen by the sun, bounded by stone and tree, 
is a currency which resists both the pickaxe and the printing press.

Orac Scit:
And yet, land is not without its own perils. 
What of fire, flood, and the decay of empires? 
Is not land devalued by disaster, or lost by misrule?

Euchi:
This is the heart of the matter. Land money is not static; it is cyclic, like the seasons. 
Through the cycle, the value of land—made liquid as common stock—rises and falls with fortune. 
But at each cycle’s end, all claims converge: the holder is redeemed at 110% of the original value. 
The risk and gain are known in advance; no one is left in ruin by surprise, nor enriched by chance alone.

Orac Scit:
So, let us examine:
Suppose A sells common stock to B. 
In the course of the cycle, improvements and public works raise the value by 20%. 
B sells to C for a profit. All are content. 
In the next cycle, more improvements are foreseen, and the matrix reflects this. 
Buyers see an opportunity—a further 30% rise is possible. 
But the limit is set by the cycle: the maximum return is known.
Thus, speculation is productive, not reckless.

Euchi:
Exactly. And if calamity strikes—a fire burns the land to ash, its value cut to a third
—the owner still has the motive and means to restore it. 
He may rebuild, make the land fire-resistant, and recover both value and standing. 
The cycle is a net, catching the fall, giving time for recovery.
At worst, the stockholder receives the agreed redemption; 
at best, both owner and holder prosper from honest effort.

Orac Scit:
This, then, is the difference:
	Gold can be diluted.
	Fiat can be devalued.
	Land, by its cycles and bounds, is shielded from both.
No monopoly can seize the earth, for the public and wild claim all loss. 
No inflation gnaws at the value, for all see and verify the land’s worth.

Euchi:
And so, with land as money, the people are not at the mercy of distant kings or hidden mines, 
but of their own labor and stewardship.
The cycle is the proof against both panic and pride.
The return is slow, sure, and anchored to reality.
This is no fantasy—it is the currency of a living nation.

Citizenry Resident Community Rural
Citizens are adults with roles within a community & in the nation.
Residents are non-citizens with no stable roots, immigrants or under punitive exclusion. 
All adults have a say, but only citizens are able to vote in law & jury.

Citizens & residents are responsible for government & community well-being.
Exist no taxes and the effort to maintain society is the burden of all who live there.
✦
American easement is the right to pass through, but not to settle.
Residence requires approval from the community. 

Community is not isolated from the world. 
Globe pressures nation. Nation pressures side. Side pressures region. Region pressures community.
People have proven that an efficient transmission of public actions. 
The flow of observer posting video onto a platform. 
Then for the society to determine the correct action. 
Correct reaction trumps rapid response. 
Individuals are known and the proper action will be taken, correctness > quickness. 

'Let each citizen stand, not as a tenant in a corporate state, but as a steward of a living community. Where every hand builds & every public dispute weighed by peers, then justice need not a throne' -- ORAC SCIT
✦
A failed-state needs to be uprooted as resultant of ill foundation & improper growth.
All titles in township are nullified. All town lands will be returned under local jurisdiction.

All land & buildings are community distributed assets. 
Applicant goes through a interview process & probationary period in a public role.

Citizens: Jury, Legislation, Permits, Inspection, Code, Militia
Utility Business: Energy, Water, Communications
Residents: Public-Works, Waste-Management, Parks, Welfare service

Clear roles and accountability to individual. 
Acts are recorded as witnesses, both individual & another, to loyalty & service.
✦
Proper community is built by design of the new order.

Core of town is the neighborhood of town leadership, the basis for a functioning community:
	{ Orator, Doctor, Militia Command, Fire & Rescue, Infrastructure }

Town structure of zones expanding out.
Core community residences, Town Hall & gathering-park.
Major business headquarters
Larger social buildings: grocery, school, hospital, well-fare
Urban neighborhoods, parks, wildlife habitation
Rural Land: Large buildings, factories, farms, public land, ancestral land, wildlife-only-zones

1) Core community neighborhood has sets of houses designated to each role: Active, Apprentice, Retiree.
Mentor, current & third choice apprentice are available in the same area.
The service to the community grants their house until matrimonial death.
Residences will be built for comfortable respect & live-in-stations for emergency work.
Residence is tied to the role of service.

2) Business can only exist within a stable society, thus community supersedes employment obligation.
How well one contributes to the community trumps excellence in business. 
Businesses operate on a lease from the community.

4) Families work their way up in the community. From temporary probation, residency non-citizen, stable citizen housing, to long-standing family reputation.
If an individual becomes lethargic, family members must step up to fulfill community service to retain status.
Long-standing families with continued service attain the highest degree of stability, their choice to stay or upgrade. 

Movement to towns with culture suited to the temperament of the family is normal. 
Reputation is always carried forward. This allows a way to ease community friction.

Community assigns the distribution of residences in a public & open-source fashion.

Dialogue: Citizen Resident Rural
	
Euchi:
Friends, the age of slumber is ended.
All that lived for itself, or fed upon the labor of others, is swept away. 
Here, the only home is the one built and kept by service. 
All serve; none escape. The core is not inherited but earned. Speak: who objects?

Kleon:
Euchi, your doctrine is sharp as the sword—perhaps too sharp. 
Tell me, if all must serve, what of the crippled, the broken, the simple of mind? 
Does not your meritocracy risk becoming another tyranny—only now by “function,” not blood or coin?

Euchi:
No one escapes the burden, nor the dignity, Kleon.
There are roles for all; even the weakest may sweep, the slowest may watch, the least skilled may aid. The only shame is in refusing all contribution.
In aiding the cripple, the cripple return aid.

Thalion:
Yet is it not mercy that distinguishes a just city?
 What of forgiveness, of rest? 
If pain is the forge, do we not risk breaking spirits that might, with time, mend? 
What of grace for the disgraced, and respite for the exhausted?

Euchi:
All are allowed rest, Thalion—retirement is honored. 
Forgiveness is the air we breathe; for if all are known, all need it in turn. 
Yet none shall be permitted the luxury of uselessness
—each must find their function, and serve.

Kleon:
And if a function excludes, if the core grows clannish? 
You abolish birthright only to risk a new priesthood of “fit ones.” 
Will the unfit forever sweep, never ascend?


Euchi:
Entry is by public record and real merit, not secret favor. 
The path upward exists; let all who strive be seen. 
If cliques form, their deeds are also seen—none may hide behind closed doors.

Demos:
But what if I find no place? 
What if my gifts are not wanted here, but the next town over?
 Will I be forced to wander, forever an outsider?

Euchi:
Travel to the community which is harmonious to your ability.
Is this not the only true path of life, not easy but always of greater value to find community.
Seek where you are needed. 
Each community shapes itself, but all honor the same law: visible contribution.

Thalion:
But what of the soul’s needs? Who tends to song, to faith, to beauty? 
If only function matters, will not the city grow hard, and hearts grow cold?

Euchi:
Art, faith, and care are no less service than fire or law.
 Let them be weighed, let them prove their worth by the life they bring.
Else should law demand respect by force.
Your choices build your ability -- choose wisely.

Kleon:
And justice? Your courts rise from local to world, 
but if every step is watched and every plea is logged, 
does not the shadow of record itself become a tyranny? 
Who forgives when the ledger remembers all?

Euchi:
Forgiveness is not the erasure of truth, Kleon, 
but the act of knowing and choosing anew. 
A record may scar, but it may also protect.

Demos:
And who ensures that your “new birth” does not become a new chain, heavier than the last? 
How do we know the struggle is worth the pain?

Euchi:
The question is open, Demos, and must ever be. 
There is no system that cannot harden, no liberty that cannot die. 
The guard against tyranny is not in law alone, but in living memory and unending vigilance.
A society cultivated to recognize vices and their cure.

Thalion:
So then, the greatest question remains unanswered: 
How do we build a city that does not merely replace old cruelties with new, 
but learns—forever, and in every heart—to forgive, to renew, to see worth in all?

Euchi:
That is the question for every age, Thalion. 
Let us write it in the stones of this square, that we may never forget.



“How do we build a city that does not merely replace old cruelties with new, but learns—forever, and in every heart—to forgive, to renew, to see worth in all?”


Open Source
All procedure is open source from government to enterprise.
Citizens are able to inspect sensitive documents.

No Copyrights. 
All take to build and must pay forward.
What one builds then they execute to the best of their ability to gain.

Once revenue is received then the procedure must be made open source.
This allows a window of accumulation, of inventory or constructions, which allow head-start due to initiative.

Artificial Intelligence can flag open-patents by predefined vectors of exploitation, and also any predefined vectors of inefficiency. 
Clarity of how the product stands against global competition will increase effectiveness of investors in common stock of the business.

Owner Employee Investor
Companies are tied to family lineage to an accountable owner.
Ownership is transferred exclusively as inheritance to heir.
A company is solely dissolved by sale of assets.

One company per individual.
One parcel of land per company.

Exist no partnerships or corporations.
✦
Companies exist as structures dependent on society. 
Thus company books are accessible to the public. 
Citizen marshals only able to access sensitive-records.

Inter-company and investor meeting-minutes or correspondence are public records.
Massive undertakings require modularization of many discrete companies.
One Ring independently allocates Citizen Marshalls which is a cost of the undertaking.
✦
Society & business rely upon each other symbiotically.
Long-term stability of society allows for business prosperity.
Companies must seek to establish long-term stability for employees and the improvement of the welfare of society.
✦
Exist three types of inheritable company-stock: Owner, Employee, Investor.

Owner Stock:
the founder individual which bootstraps a company.
a minimum investment of 30% of personal-assets.
full-time work on the endeavor until investors are paid in full.
single individual owner holding publicly accountable executive power.
major companies decisions are subject to a 2/3 compromise in event of action-veto.

Employee Stock:
voting rights weighted by tenure.
vetos force a compromise which favors the owner decision in a ratio of 2/3.
Compensation composed of base pay and performance-driven pay based upon metrics.

Investor Stock:
Public transaction of tangible investment.
Investment is immediate and full, no promises or fractional reserve.
Investors must remain in a passive role, illegal to influence the company.
Investment returns capped at 100% gains on original amount invested.
Indefinite repayment timeline.
Investors are the first compensated in event of asset liquidation.
Company community contributions will be made in the name of the investor.
✦
Employee Performance Calculation:

Employees are responsible for calculating the metrics of their daily contributions.
Owners must submit their own work calculation to receive above base compensation.
Owners are responsible for the management verification of daily contributions.

Contribution metrics are public & industry-normalized.

Individuals are educated since youth to comprehend the complexity of job-work accounting.
This mechanism of compensation is deeply respected and thus guarded by peer-to-peer many eyes inspection to establish honest protection.
Calculation mastery of per-job accounts, contributions, and resultant gains.

Metrics encode the company lifespan will detail efforts of each individual for each day.
This data allows payments to focus more on actions and the resulting contribution.
The time spent as unit of payment is a poor indicator of effort and breeds lazy effort.

Management verified employee actions, being guarded by the employee body, may be 

Peer-reviewed evaluation on the One Ring ensure comprehensive measures of effort.
As data sets age the vital contributions will begin to stand out clearly.

Compensation for units of employee work calculation
Compensation for units of owner work calculation
Payment of investors capped at 10% of annual revenue
Profit on owner investment
✦
Community improvement owed for each loan in the amount of 200% of original loan. 
Investor activity is proof that the owner was not ready to launch and thus put the public in an unstable situation.
Community determines how to use the money which is paid in honor of the lender.
This is paid only as able, after original lender is completely settled.

Ventures are sole proprietor entities distinct from companies.
Ventures do NOT have: company land, employees, or investors.
Ventures are not subject to any control, only criminal negligence.

Extraction of local resources can only be done by a local owner stewardship.
The oversight of confirmed multiplier will be national to avoid corruption.
Citizen Marshalls can halt-work for a period of time respective of their rank.

Region where the resource is extracted must be the recipient of the improved restoration.
Local community must approve the company establishment. 
National interest proved by science can veto company establishment.
Local public land must be improved, this is settled in community approval.
Betterment of public land must be done parallel to operations.
A trust must be accumulated prior to approval by investors. This trust is sufficient to restore the land of operations.

Dialogue: Owner Employee Investor
ORAC SCIT

Kleon: But Euchi, why do you disallow partnerships and corporations,
Structures commonly employed in our time?

Euchi: History speaks clearly, Kleon. 
Modular discrete companies, each guided by a responsible individual, 
succeed profoundly where conglomerates falter. 
Unix, Perl—these were not borne by committees but by dedicated masters. 
Conglomerates breed corruption, inefficiency, and secrecy, rather than innovation.

Kleon: Yet large undertakings demand collective effort. 
How can this be reconciled?

Euchi: Great ventures must rely upon modularization, 
numerous independent companies each accountable and transparent. 
Citizen marshals, independently assigned by One Ring, guard the integrity of these massive enterprises.

Thalion: Yet consider, Euchi, if singular ownership restricts expertise and innovation
—how will enterprises requiring multiple specialists flourish without partnerships?

Euchi: Modular structures, each led by accountable individuals, 
allow specialization without sacrificing accountability. 
The collaborative strength lies not in conglomeration but in transparent modular alliances.

Kleon: Your commitment to public transparency is admirable, 
yet may it not compromise competitive advantage and privacy?

Euchi: Transparency guards integrity and builds trust. 
Sensitive information remains accessible only to citizen marshals, 
ensuring accountability without unnecessary exposure.

Thalion: Your employment metrics intrigue me
—but do they not risk reducing complex human contributions to mere calculable units?

Euchi: A valid concern, Thalion. 
Yet, consider metrics as guides rather than absolute measures. 
Peer reviews and management oversight on One Ring maintain fairness, 
rewarding genuine contribution beyond mere hours logged.

Kleon: Euchi, Your principle of single accountable ownership intrigues me, 
but how will you address unforeseen incompetence or lack of preparedness in an heir?

Euchi: Kleon, lineage alone does not define suitability. 
Heirship may extend beyond blood through adoption
—merit, proven virtue, and capability shall govern the choice, echoing ancient wisdom.

Kleon: Euchi, the role of passive investors appears restricted and unattractive. 
Might this discourage essential capital investment?

Euchi: Passive investors recognize that effort precedes reward. 
Their role, carefully balanced, ensures they contribute without undue influence. 
The community debt serves as a safeguard,
 acknowledging the investor’s trust yet reminding us of our initial obligations.

Thalion: And your rule against fractional reserves
—do you not fear that strict adherence might limit economic flexibility?

Euchi: Prudence demands that tangible, immediate commitment underlies investment. 
While flexibility is valuable, the integrity and stability derived from full, 
immediate investment create a safer long-term economic environment.

Kleon: Lastly, resource extraction
—local oversight seems sound, but might it not breed local corruption or narrow self-interest?

Euchi: National oversight of multiplier standards ensures impartiality. 
Citizen marshals, allocated by the independent One Ring, 
balance local interests with broader ecological and social integrity.

Thalion: These points clarify much, Euchi. 
Your vision requires delicate balance and continued vigilance.

Euchi: Indeed, friends. No system is beyond refinement. 
Continued discourse is essential, illuminating our blind spots and strengthening our community bonds.


Militia & Viking
Local Militia is the only means to which man may attain any degree of liberty.
Command is never passed to a non-local entity, in order to retain independence.
✦
Defense of invasion will call up the second-in-command, leading nor more than 40% of the active official militia.
War spawns evils as a sickness across the whole body.
Integrity of the country, kept by strongholds of power, will keep long-term health & security. 
Containment of weakness to the region of invasion is vital for survival.

Security of family & home is the first maxim of the individual.
✦
To own land requires an oath to defend the borders of all in active service to the local militia.
Militia rank & deeds are immutable in the One Ring.

Heir to the residential estate is the individual which represents the parcel of land in active militia service.
One soul is required to represent each parcel of residential land in active militia service.
Roots of the nation will be the individuals of strength & capability.

Death of the heir relieves the residential land from militia duty for two generations.
The family must provide a secondary militia service such as resources or utility service.

An adopted defender is entitled as family heir upon return. 
Lineage immutably tied to the original family. If an adopted-heir attains head-of-family, the next heir must be from the original family line. 
If no man nor woman found then the family line perishes and the ancestral parcel is forsaken.
✦
Active militia will be trained in national standards in addition to local standards.

Local, state, national unite annually in peer-to-peer convention: inspection, drills, training, war-games.
Militia & Viking will be jointly ranked nationwide & against history.

Inter-militia cohesion is the greatest weakness. 
Militia operating intimately familiar standardized - yet modular - equipment has strengths: non-predictable, self-contained, unique bodies of war.  
Militia have a standard role to fill, but the method enacted is entirely unique.

Nation grade systems from voluntary One Ring contribution: missiles, radar, ships. 
Top ranked individuals will be granted custody of nation grade systems. 

Decommission of rank, will be evidenced by inspection, then judged by national jury.
Decommission of rank will result in forced removal of heir. 
Continued fault will result in forfeiture of militia assets & the ancestral parcel forsaken.

The king has no military command. 
If a man scheme to set himself as a military usurper then he steals the claim which the king sacrificed to preserve individuality.
Cultivation of a homogeneous hatred to usurpers will prove: a part can never rise greater than the whole in a healthy society.

Official rank ties family lineage accountability to the commission of rank or custodianship.
No active member of a militia, nor equipment, may commit to foreign viking war.

Non-heir members of militia, unofficial in title only, may participate fully in the militia.
Non-heir members of the militia can not hold official rank nor be granted custodianship national equipment. Capable non-heir may be sponsored into command from a heir who puts their family-reputation on the line in gains or losses.
Unofficial members of the militia may hold sponsored command & operation of national equipment.
Unofficial members exist to train capable militia with the freedom to assist defense or engage in viking affairs.
Unofficial engagement will be public on the One Ring and allows growth by deeds to establish respectably earned roots in local & national society.
✦
Family lines will invest considerably in heirloom equipment to protect lineage, a convergence to Gundam Suits.
Viking clans will also accumulate grand armaments funded by conquest.
National efforts will fund concerted efforts to monolithic powers.

Equipment from supplies, arms, to vehicles will all be in the hands of the citizenry.
The firepower of the nation will reside within the stewardship of the people.
✦
Foreign policy is set by the King and effected by Vikings.

Vikings are voluntary only force. 
Viking commanders can not control a command greater than the size of the median national militia. 
Offense will not weaken defense.

Proceeds of Viking ventures will be publicly disclosed & publicly distributed by contribution metrics compiled by evidence and witness.

One Ring platform will facilitate Viking disputes of contributions.
One Ring vote of 3:2 allow dishonorable forfeiture of a Viking.

Judge & Jury
Judge aggregates Juror decisions then commits sentence within bounds of explicit laws.

Judges are first chosen by meritocracy and then backed by ancestral honor.
Greatest weight is on a family lineage which has proven consistence over age.

Audits on One Ring by Councils & Artificial Intelligence compile an appropriate quantity of qualified Jurors.
Judge & Juror are assigned domains at time of inauguration.
Domains are appended by public qualification.
10 Year Cycle process the shame of retractions of domain. 

Judgements of Judge & decisions of Juror are public on One Ring.
Any corruption, undeclared bias, or undeclared affiliation that is discovered violate the Axiom of Oath.

Only after Juror decisions & Judge sentence can the convict be arrested.
Axiom of Domain sanctifies home which can only be sieged, but never invaded.
Non-voluntary arrests are a fast-track to capital punishment.

Convicts may appeal to different Judge & Jurors. 
The region of selection of court is broader, but the sentence is unilaterally more severe. 
Standing amendments authorize explicit parameters of Kingly-Pardon & Popular-Veto.
Amendment standing is in relation to date of initial sentence. 
A new cycle will not change sentence of a prior cycle.

There are no jails nor enslavement.
Exist only immediate punishment or exile under penalty of death.
Punishment is effected in a public display.

Capital punishment of Treason or Murder.
Crimes of sex will result in the scalping of the sexual organ.
Severe, but merciful sentences, result in amputations.
Whipping or beating is effected by an unassociated professional.

Plato’s villain of the prolific, the ever-present leech, the merchant. Thief of the laborers due.
Government takes a portion of the gross sale. 
Merchant takes a 30%+ cut of the sale. Government then again takes a portion of the profit.

Public conditions of workers, of animals, or the materials used. 
Distributed responsibility allow no single-point of corruption to vice.

Value of the One Ring to safeguard the earnings of business boosts the resilience of the network. 
Thus incentivizing the business sector to maintain their own nodes.

Societal ostracism will only affect regional production. 
Business can shift target demographics to remain productive.

Direct communication of business to consumer is established.
Monopolistic tactics have no ground to anchor enslavement.

Man Meat
The sanctity to respect life has no place for mercy. 
To betray this right is to cross a point of no return for the victim & perpetrator.

If a man murder an innocent, and the cowardice of the society jails him for decades. 
Then the cost of the innocent life taken, is given a definite measure. 
This measure being less than the value of the life of the murderer.

Value is based upon cost. Murderer will be executed. 
Retribution for the murder of an innocent will be absolute.

Society's greatest perpetrators will bless the animal kingdom with fresh meat.
✦ 
Society converges to respect all life or diverges to respect no life.

Humans feed on meat sourced from the death of the animal kingdom.
Mankind must balance this debt with meat from its own dead.

To eat meat is to build a debt paid in death. 
To balance humans into non-parasitic equilibrium with the universe.

A dead cow can produce thousands of human meals spanning years with negligible waste.
An animal predator reduces the effect of the death of a cow to only a small set of fresh feeders and possibly small groups of scavengers upon unhealthy scraps.
This waste is indisputably drastic compared to the efficiency of human processing. 

A predator fed by man-meat, kibbles & bit preserves, spares prey in the animal kingdom. 
✦
Mankind, prehistoric to the Fall of Rome, has offered meat from its own species to animals. 
Pride has grown a rift between the distinction between the sanctity of human & animal life. 

Man-meat is of the highest-quality and ranks as a large-meat source compounded by overpopulation.

Punitive execution will be effected in a public feeding zone of the local mascot.
If a society is to have execution, then this act must be public.
Private executions allow for many forms of conspiracy such as substitution.
A society which condemns a soul to death by feeding, must not turn a blind eye to the consequences of damnation.

Social interaction with mascots will embed knowledge of consequence.
A special offering of fresh, well-nourished, proven predator as prey to a more vicious predator.
 
Death by all causes, if suitable for preservation of meat, will be processed into kibbles & bits.
✦
War is a permanent facet of life. 
Exist a world-wide demand of man-meat.
Sacrifices of man's life lost to a cause can benefit the country, and bless the animals therein.
First, animals being innocently burdened by the war of the region, will receive the major portion of man-meat preserves.
Vikings, only after, can receive their loot of the man-meat.
✦
Animal offering transcends sacrifice unto society, into an act benevolent to the universe.


Dialogue: On the Doctrine of Man Meat
ORAC SCIT

Euchi: Friends, today let us examine the doctrine of “Man Meat.” 
The core is this: society respects all life or respects none. 
A murderer who takes innocent life violates the foundation of order and thus forfeits his own. 
His execution serves justice absolutely, and in death, returns balance by nourishing the animal kingdom. Is this doctrine wise and just?

Kleon: Euchi, you propose execution without mercy or rehabilitation for murderers. 
Yet does this not assume infallibility in judgment? 
How can society guard against wrongful executions?

Euchi: A vital concern, Kleon. This is precisely why execution must be public, visible, and visceral. 
When all eyes bear witness, the officials responsible face maximum accountability. 
The fear of misjudgment thus ensures justice is measured and meticulous.

Thalion: Yet, Euchi, I fear you tread a path of profound brutality. 
Is not mercy, forgiveness, and the possibility of redemption the hallmark of a truly civilized society? 
Does your doctrine not risk reducing justice to mere vengeance?

Euchi: Your concern is noble, Thalion, but misplaced. 
True mercy draws clear lines. 
Lesser offenses may indeed seek redemption and rehabilitation. 
Murder, however, is an irrevocable act—a point of no return. 
Forgiveness here is not mercy but an abdication of justice, 
serving only the greed of institutions that profit from punishment rather than resolve crime.

Kleon: Even accepting this, Euchi, the notion of human bodies as “meat” for animals troubles me deeply. Does this not strip the human corpse of dignity and sacredness, descending into barbarity?

Euchi: Quite the opposite, Kleon. 
Your notion of human exceptionalism is itself barbaric. 
The civilized intellect recognizes the dignity and interconnectedness of all life. 
To return human flesh to animals is not desecration but restoration, 
repaying our debt to the animal kingdom from which humanity continually takes. 
In this balance, dignity resides not in hoarding our bodies but in harmonizing with the universe.

Thalion: Euchi, you speak of cosmic balance, 
yet does this practice not risk a society desensitized to violence, 
numb to the spectacle of public execution?

Euchi: The execution is neither spectacle nor entertainment, Thalion. 
It is solemn, necessary accountability. 
Public transparency prevents conspiracies and injustices hidden behind closed doors. 
The horror witnessed in such acts mirrors precisely the gravity of the original crime. 
To sanitize death is to diminish the gravity of murder itself.

Kleon: But Euchi, do you not fear misuse by powerful actors 
who might exploit this doctrine under the guise of justice?

Euchi: Vigilance must always accompany any powerful doctrine. 
Public oversight, stringent criteria, and absolute equality before the law
—whether vagrant or king
—are safeguards woven into the very fabric of this doctrine. 
The same standard of ultimate justice applies to all.

Euchi: Your challenges sharpen this vision, friends. 
Indeed, justice is not static—it demands constant refinement and vigilance. 
Let us revisit and refine our doctrine continually, 
ensuring that our quest for cosmic balance and absolute justice remains true.

Kleon & Thalion: So it must be, Euchi. 
Dialogue is our greatest safeguard. We shall revisit this again.
