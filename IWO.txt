Individual World Order
Individual-centric axiom-governed society



Strength in Diversity

The scope of this societal treatise is complete; all major components of society are unified unto a single virtue: Individuality.
✦
No known government in history has evolved towards health. 
History proves civilizations decay due faults rooted in the inability of structure to resolve predictable human behavior.

Fault of the individual: 
	{ pride, envy, wrath, sloth, greed, gluttony, lust }

Fault of the group:
	{ type-hate, cartel, censor, monopoly, treason, pacification, territorial }

This set of universal-faults is kept central to the design of the system.
Structures are established to repel the set of faults with counter-virtues.
✦
A theory may be practically-flawed yet may evolve into success by wise-implementation.
A theoretically-flawed construct has no hope of success.

First: mankind must develop a complete theory of society which considers all its departments. No part in contradiction to the whole's foundational logic.

Then: this theory must be distilled over time by speculative implementation, to round cohesive evolution.

Finally: the structure will be ready for the commitment of a bold nation. Revolution begun with a clear understanding of successful steps towards reformation.

A nation is most vulnerable after a revolution: 
	prior nation exhausted to a break-point ➡︎ 
	followed by prolonged revolutionary war ➡︎ 
	international debt & collateral ➡︎ 
	debts lead to compromises which enable a new tyrant

Compromises are essential. 
Yet a compromises often contradict the Constitution of a nation.
If any basis thread is severed by compromise, then the woven constitution frays over time, and under stress breaches the integrity of the whole.

Once the Constitution fails, no nation afterwards resumes integrity.
Corruption damned since installment by integrity floods and permeates all layers of society - with all the wiles of a starved predator wise enough to secure territory foremost.
✦
Theory & trial of a new Constitution must precede revolution.
Thereby ensuring compromises never undermine the foundation.
✦
A Republic is a corrupted form of Aristocracy.

America revolted without a clear & simple structure to adhere to in the tumult of the transmutation.
America built a federal republic, which was in contradiction against the intent of revolutionaries seeking individual liberty.

A republic is an aristocracy, rule of the mass by the few powerful.

The single distinction of a republic from aristocracy: hereditary domain can never be official. 
This generalization, from official lineage into non-official & non-public dominion, allowed power to become available to any person of power - free of oversight. 

Republics are rife with treason.
Citizens empowered by fortune and immigrants backed by foreign powers.

Aristocracy bound power to native family lines. 
This official tract served as an essential pillar of the people to check powers of the deciding body.

Democracy has never been implemented.
Plain logic disproves the theory in small scale.

Aristocracy will suffer for a better journey because it has the scope of secure future.
Masses, who have no secure future, will always choose the path which returns best in the moment - regardless of the longterm effects.

Divine Lineage is the only government proven to be sustainable for centuries.
✦
Deep state corruption, being past redemption, dies in slow romanic-erosion hidden by illusions of the extorters.

IWO is bound united as glass: it will hold true or shatter in plain view to the public. 
The entire framework is simple and can be taught to every citizen.
Cyclic Constitutions allow IWO to conform to the current generation, being freed from perpetual laws.

This work does not pretend perfection; it facilitates sane evolution. 
The Opensource nature invites any to improve & offer suggestions. 
The purpose is to build an implementable system well-honed for a nation in revolution to achieve a logical society.

Foundational Axiom
Organizations converge to one group gaining total monopoly. 
The lifecycle of organization: control the government to cater lifestyle, oppress the masses for gain, lastly internal-self-consumption.

Definitions
Ideals are defined as ideas which are never attained. Each action, by common sense perception, either approaches or distances from the Ideal.

Ideals are critical in offering humanity invariant hope, each faithful step rewards a more perfect state of being in regard to the idea.

Each generation has its own evolved definition of the Ideal.

Convergence is the definite & provable approach towards an Ideal.

Divergence is any action which trends away from an Ideal.

Integration of all information (each a standardized element) from independent methods, compiled into an image of each generation.

Each generation is compared against the compiled history.
Image of each generation is projected - under convolution with the set of all generations.
Shape of each generation clearly accounted against historic states to depict an honest state of existence.

Decentralization is the independence of source & implementation - from any central control. 
Communities of individual entities operate critical infrastructure for communication.
Community militia operate independent from federal command.
Jury of volunteers can vote in courts, where any is able to voice a statement.

Individual is the single discrete societal entity. 

Organization is a structured group of individuals which submit to the will of the leader.
	{ government, corporation, religion, sect, extended-family }

Axioms of Liberty
Axioms of Liberty form the rights of humanity. 
This is a minimal set which alone form the immutable kernel of all society in every age.  
These Axioms are based upon the American Bill of Rights. 


Life: right of all life as given by birth. Exist no right of dependence. Execution as jury judgement. Ideal: all life is sacred. Anti: existence as resource.
Liberty: right of choice, but not from consequence. No slavery. No arrest without jury warrant. No jails: immediate punishment or exile. Arrest only to the extent of obtaining identity & proof of criminal action. Exist no conscription.
Speech: right of speech. Action must be entirely confined to speech: leading a mob is not speech, organizing is not speech, proven-threat is not speech. Printed content is protected by speech. Threat without means of fulfillment is speech. Pulpit in commons is protected by speech if it only calls for individual contemplation.
Arms: right to arm. If government can equip a specific arm, then Individual can likewise equip the arm.
Oath: right to hold office accountable. Institutionalized: breach of axioms, treason against nation, betrayal against countryman. Purge - if proven valid - glorifies the Individual.
Freedom: right of movement. Easement of identified-individuals and animals across all space that is not residence-home. This does not protect loitering.
Domain: right of domain of the Individual. Domain of the Individual: family, residence, land, business assets & profits.
Privacy: right to private communications. Non-private communication: govt, organizational & business. No spy, entrapment, nor seizure of information. 
Belief: right of personal belief. Family-only worship on residential-land. Illegal to worship in organization or extended-family. 
God: right of divine lineage. Single head of nation and lineage of succession. Lineage of the Individual bound in survival to The Divine Lineage.Individual
Individual is the only entity in society; the unit of measure in a homogenous historical framework.

Individual is the entity of the adult - responsible for self. 
Individual is the entity of the household - responsible for dependents.
Individual is the entity of the God - responsible for nation.

As individual exists over self, is as individual over household, is as individual over nation.
Responsibility & accountability is only scaled, but never warped to be inconsistent in a generalized situation.
✦
The Individual unit compiles a nation into an exhaustive & explicit map of the society at any point in time to produce direct measurements.
Homogenity of the Individual unit allows clear & robust comparison of current records to historic states - all based upon the same unit.
✦
Individual unit is exposed due to its isolated nature. 
Societal hierarchy is explicit.
Exist no organization able to mask privilege.
✦
Individual is defined as an accountable adult entity:
	{ man, woman, head(husband-wife), head(husband-wife-children-elderly), owner(employee), master(apprentice), commander(militia), judge(jury), king(nation) }

Individuals are the sole holders of power: 
	{ economic, militia, political, judicial, social, civic, academic }
✦
Head of household is an official power of familiar governance.
Line of succession is public information.

Community may force choice of heir to court, under claims of clan establishment.
DNA is public researchable data used to curb clan establishments by wedlock or adoption. 

Adoption never supplants the official bloodline.

Extinguished bloodlines condemn the ancestral-land to wild-lands.
✦
Every 6 months the Head of household is required to vacate the region.
Family stays at home to vote to reaffirm or replace the Head.

This resolution is officially submitted to the community.
Upon return the Head must accept the family choice or face expulsion enforced by the community.
Mismanagement or abuse is checked by family decision.
Family suffers the failures of the Head, and thus has a right in choice of governance.
✦
Individual centric society converges to independence, responsibility and honor.
Individual societies cultivate competition in diversity; well-adapted to season and region.
✦
Life requires time & space in which to exist.

Ancestral home is the domain of the Individual:
	to enshrine family lineage over time.
	to pass forward inheritance of space immune from loss.
✦
In ungoverned wilds, balance & harmony exist naturally.

Organization of mankind establishes constructs which contradict & deny principles inherited by all forms of life.

First, society must return to the simplicity of the irreducible entity, the Individual.
Atop this primordial, universal foundation - society can build intelligent progression.



God
God is the crowned head of the nation.

As the Individual holds domain over self, by inheritance.
As the Individual holds domain over household, by inheritance.
As the Individual holds domain over business, by inheritance.
As the Individual holds domain over nation, by inheritance.

Public Office of the God is only the scaling of domain.
If an action is consistent with the self, with the household, with the business - then that action is consistent of God unto nation.
✦
Society establishes the laws which govern the nation, isolated from the influence of the Divine Family.
God administers, but does not create the law.

Citizen Marshalls, being individuals highly scrutinized, are self-appointed checks upon the administration of God. Where God is not able to act, the Citizen Marshalls act, each independent. 
✦
God builds society to health; the nation a secure inheritance to Divine Lineage.
Society commits to honor The Divine Lineage in all respects, or enact a complete purge of the Divine Lineage.

Marriage until death of the entire nation; do a Divine Lineage & Nation part.
All ownership titles are nullified, and the nation must be rebuilt entirely.
✦
Society establishes laws which are checked into balance by God.

God issues divine veto, the ZENG-ZI, by direct messengers.
Posting the express will of God, which are not enactable under current law.

ZENG-ZI is written upon unique red-paper & unique black ink. 
Identifiable to each God. 

ZENG-ZI remains at the designated community post for three months.

Veto is then voted on:
	7:10 is a full & immediate instatement of the will of God.
	4:10 is a compromise weighing in favor of God relative to the ratio.

Compromise must reach 7:10 ratio of agreement.
It is written on unique black-paper & unique red-ink.
Identifiable to each community.

ZENG-ZI & Compromises are proof of an unstable societal state.
They are stored as pair in the community Divine Temple.

ZENG-ZI is proof of disharmony between the will of the nation and its God.
Compromises are proof of disrespect of God as the head of the nation.

This interaction is mar upon the nation in history, and to the world.

Disharmony breeds dishonor which extends from head of nation, to militia, to business, to household.

International reputation suffers in these exchanges.
✦
Society, as the household to the head, has the right to cage the administration of God to the extreme triviality as a mere figurehead. 

Temperament of God effects how society creates laws.

Historic & international honor checks how the nation respects God.
Low respect of God hurts international business, and respect of family lines.

Harmonious & involved Gods: will shape the nation by administration of laws reflective of the current society.

Disharmonious & involved Gods: will contend with the current society, throttled by 3 month duration per ZENG-ZI. 

Harmonious or disharmonious & uninvolved Gods: individuals under Oath will administer the nation.
✦
Administration of the law has a major effect on the character of the actual implementation.
Therein lies the power of God to shape the nation.

Exist immediate constraints upon God to relinquish administration.  
Such action is a public drastic disgrace to the entire nation.
✦
God has the liberty to choose how divine influence will affect the nation.

God has the right to choose any office in administration.
Involvement in the highest capacity, elevated by Divinity.

God disharmonious in one position and being zoned out, may find harmony in another area of administration. 

God retains the right to failure.
Lineage of the Divine House
God sets the order of inheritance position by explicit listing.

ZENG-ZI sets the globally known succession of Divine Lineage by red-ink upon gold-paper.
Rejection by 8:10 is posted by each community by gold-ink upon black-paper.

The nation will not be burdened by the will of a deceased God.
✦
At all times the line of succession is publicly known.

Each position gains the approval of the nation by public ordeal.
Each Individual is well scrutinized their entire life. 

Disharmonious Divinity can only exist:
	Individual failure in consistency.
	incorrect assessment of the nation.

The nation is able to learn how to better assess succession when mistakes are made.

Distant relatives and adoption follow the same rules as a household. 
DNA bloodline, being publicly known, will converge the bloodline back into power.
✦
Central objective of the Divine House: cultivate & foster virtue of stability.
Set the standard-form for the nation to adopt.

Divine House is a stately organization, being composed by God and confirmed by the nation.
The House represents the nation at the world stage.

Each nation is represented by their respective Divine House. 
Standards & customs are distilled into sharp cultures of diversity.
✦
Chinese establish harems to allow extreme diversity of the bloodline across the nation.
Many families attain access to Diving Lineage by wedlock.

Europeans keep small family cores. Focus upon simplicity which avoids a constant battle for positions, at the cost of volatile bloodlines.

Africans favor warrior females, with an emphasis on adoption, to nurture strength as a true meritocracy. 

Tribal kingdoms set each citizen as family which appoints God from the oldest & wisest.
One Ring Platform [ORP]
ORP is the information hub of the society from local to global.
The platform hosts decentralized, synchronized, immutable data.

Humanities greatest strength is collective reasoning. 
Unaltered history gives the future freedom to learn from the past.

Information flows freely & symmetrical.
Equality of information-access is established between citizen and official.
If one has public data, then all have access to the public data.
✦
Every adult individual is required to be processed onto ORP.
Freedom of movement is enabled by public information of identity & position.

Identity is verified by biometrics; exist no fake accounts.
This establishes community safety which is endangered by Liberty.

Authenticity of action on ORP is robust by stranger-witnesses.
These allow any individual to confirm identity in person and posting the result.
✦
Immutable data favors honesty. 
Lies are permanent marks.
Public history of the Individual is public information.

Individuals may post on their own profile.
Society may comment unrestricted onto profiles of others.
✦
Official lines of information flow:
Household -> Community -> County -> State -> Region -> Nation -> Continent -> Globe -> Extraterrestrial.

Stored data is the medium of the security of society. 
All data is Opensource and freely transferrable.
Any one is able to maintain a decentralized node to contribute to the platform: 
	{ historic, current, archived, online, unique-focus, broad swathe }

Stable information is archived in compressed forms.

Data can be accessed online, from offline archives, from foreign confirmations.

Manipulations of data will be a true feat.
Family in America & Hong-Kong archives the other's data.
American archives when questioned for corruption can be confirmed by an isolate sources.
✦
Main information exists on 8 server nodes:
	{ DNA, Vote, Jury, Citizenry, Militia, Business, Social, Legislation }

One of each type of server node connects to a reconciliation node, whose job it is to synchronize versions with other reconciliation nodes.

Current working cached data, being less stable but concurrent, stored in high-traffic registers.
Archived data, stabilized by time & independence of region, stored in online or offline.
✦
Reconciliation nodes are the primary gate of security, being maintained by reputation of the Household.
Reconciliation nodes communicate amongst themselves to reach agreement of data content.

Once the update of data is stable, it is pushed onto the respective octagon-node-set.

Main updates throughout the network-backbone are done by secure notarized nodes.
All instability of data only exists between communication amongst reconciliation nodes.
Only after stability of updates, does the nodes of the Octagon receive information.
✦
Network primary backbone is not the only path.
Exist many interconnected peer-to-peer connections which operate in non-standard ways.

Yet all forms of information flow must agree with the resolutions of reconciliation nodes: 
	{ independent flows, offline drive transfers, global positioning }
✦
Faces of the octagon are independent in synchronization.
Failure to reach agreement of update will stall all nodes of that family from update.
Other faces will proceed normally.

Data versioning & synchronization are the vital algorithms of the entire IWO infrastructure.
Generations will hone these procedures into stable evolution.
✦
Many sectors of IWO rely directly upon ORP.
Powerful facets of society have a critical interest in maintaining & upgrading the network.

Strong sectors build powerful nodes which benefit the entire network.
Individual enthusiasts supplement the network authenticity with an independent isolation of power.
✦
Access keys are all one-time usage.
Access is a resource that allows node administrators to gain profit from establishing a good reputation.

Sections of the One Ring Platform

Identification
Biometric confirmation by sensors.
	{ face, voice, thumbprint, ...}

Current public location is public information.
Sensors exist in all public spaces and many other spaces for the sake of security.
Movement is identified or proven to be circumventing lawful freedom.

Witness
Witness is an independent verification between two individuals, peer to peer. 
Quick interaction, between confirmed-strangers, uses proximity-based protocols to confirm mutual identity. 

Serious actions require several witnesses. 
This provides verification of the individual to the stance. 
	{ vote, juror deciding, veto, amendment … }

DNA
DNA & Lineage, are public information vital to keep harmony in a multicultural society.
Safeguard against racial dominance, family clan organizations, and proximity to bloodline extinction.

DNA is verified periodically at the minimum of once every 10 years, by local-national-international.

Wealth
Land, Assets, Distributed-Assets are all public. 
Resources are of national interest.
Resources are produced by a nation, not by an Individual alone.
Nation has the authority to know where its resources exist.

Land is the most stable form of wealth, and is established as the foundation of the monetary system.

Residential Wealth:
	{ ancestral-land, common-land-stock, redistributed-assets}

Business Wealth:

Any adult my volunteer for Juror service.
Each statement is posted equally.

Individuals gain respect due to measurable skills in:
	{ articulation, research, on-scene investigations, understanding of situation, 			judgement }

Statements exist to enlighten the perspectives of the case. 
Comments exist to forge truth from debate.

Business
Work|product comment-based reviews.

Exist no restrictions nor moderation of posts or comments.

The voice of each Individual is able reach the globe and the future.
This is the greatest check upon society. 
	{ news, witness, origination, perspective, testimony, merit }



10 Year Cycle
Harmonious systems are cyclic.
✦
Axioms are the invariant virtues of the society.

All other laws are cyclic in a 10-Year period.
Society has an appointed time period to create law system, being new or derivative of the past.

Cyclic Constitutions allow the laws and government to be adapted to each generation.
This serves as a time to recenter & recalibrate.
Then to stabilize for 10-Years, the laws only being subject to ZENG-ZI veto.
During this period of stable laws, the Individual may build a composition to propose for the next cycle.
✦
Historic compositions of laws are available along with the raw data of effects.

Conservative or radical, this is the liberty of choice for each period.
All information is recorded immutable to pass forward victory & failure equally.
✦
Three stages of the 10 Year Cycle: 
	{ choice-assessment, vote, ratification, implementation }

Proposals are created & polled during the previous cycle. 
This favors long-lived popularity of a proposal to prove itself over long-term survival at top. 
This is the stage where the proposal adapts to compromise.

The 10-Year Festival is a time for commitment not discussion.

The 10-Year Festival starts with an immediate vote of all proposals.
Voting assessment is stabilized, and then ratified before the end of the Festival.

Implementation is begun on the first day of the 10-Year period.
✦
Ninth year of the 10-year period:
	ZENG-ZI does not operate.
	year is to prepare & research, not to make changes.
	DNA census conducted and international verifications of identity.
	ORP Witness protocols.
	Festivals to celebrate Individuals across the nation facilitate Witness.

Proposals & influencers are listed at the start of the year.
✦
Tenth Month Eve, all strong influencers are banned from social practice & communication.

Confinement upon estate lands, guarded by militia: 
	{ Divine Family, top government officials, ORP voted, AI chosen }

Confinement or foreign vacation:
	{ creators of proposals, ORP voted, AI chosen }

Selection is proof of prestige. 
This invariant isolation is expected and long-prepared.
The cost of peaceful vote & implementation.
✦
Second month releases the lockdown of influencers.

No confined Individual is allowed back into society until public oath to affirm the 10-Year Constitution. 
Failure to accept the new Constitution results in banishment.

The Divine Family & Influencers may parade across the nation.
Festival for society to give gifts of thanks for the time sacrificed in isolation.

God creates a calligraphic ZENG-ZI of the new Constitution for each region of the nation.
This is required and serves as ratified commitment to adhere to the laws set.
✦
Assessment of Individual comprehension of the new Constitution is required before access to ORP is restored.






Citizenry Resident Community Rural
Citizens are adults with roles within a community & in the nation.
Residents are non-citizens with no stable roots, immigrants or under punitive exclusion. 
All adults have a say, but only citizens are able to vote in law & jury.

Citizens & residents are responsible for government & community well-being.
Exist no taxes and the effort to maintain society is the burden of all who live there.
✦
American easement is the right to pass through, but not to settle.
Residence requires approval from the community. 

Community is not isolated from the world. 
Globe pressures nation. Nation pressures side. Side pressures region. Region pressures community.
People have proven that an efficient transmission of public actions. 
The flow of observer posting video onto a platform. 
Then for the society to determine the correct action. 
Correct reaction trumps rapid response. 
Individuals are known and the proper action will be taken, correctness > quickness. 

'Let each citizen stand, not as a tenant in a corporate state, but as a steward of a living community. Where every hand builds & every public dispute weighed by peers, then justice need not a throne' -- ORAC SCIT
✦
A failed-state needs to be uprooted as resultant of ill foundation & improper growth.
All titles in township are nullified. All town lands will be returned under local jurisdiction.

All land & buildings are community distributed assets. 
Applicant goes through a interview process & probationary period in a public role.

Citizens: Jury, Legislation, Permits, Inspection, Code, Militia
Utility Business: Energy, Water, Communications
Residents: Public-Works, Waste-Management, Parks, Welfare service

Clear roles and accountability to individual. 
Acts are recorded as witnesses, both individual & another, to loyalty & service.
✦
Proper community is built by design of the new order.

Core of town is the neighborhood of town leadership, the basis for a functioning community:
	{ Orator, Doctor, Militia Command, Fire & Rescue, Infrastructure }

Town structure of zones expanding out.
Core community residences, Town Hall & gathering-park.
Major business headquarters
Larger social buildings: grocery, school, hospital, well-fare
Urban neighborhoods, parks, wildlife habitation
Rural Land: Large buildings, factories, farms, public land, ancestral land, wildlife-only-zones

1) Core community neighborhood has sets of houses designated to each role: Active, Apprentice, Retiree.
Mentor, current & third choice apprentice are available in the same area.
The service to the community grants their house until matrimonial death.
Residences will be built for comfortable respect & live-in-stations for emergency work.
Residence is tied to the role of service.

2) Business can only exist within a stable society, thus community supersedes employment obligation.
How well one contributes to the community trumps excellence in business. 
Businesses operate on a lease from the community.

4) Families work their way up in the community. From temporary probation, residency non-citizen, stable citizen housing, to long-standing family reputation.
If an individual becomes lethargic, family members must step up to fulfill community service to retain status.
Long-standing families with continued service attain the highest degree of stability, their choice to stay or upgrade. 

Movement to towns with culture suited to the temperament of the family is normal. 
Reputation is always carried forward. This allows a way to ease community friction.

Community assigns the distribution of residences in a public & open-source fashion. 
Adherence to strict standard protocols is the iron clad law in distributions.

Stable generational homes for long-standing citizens. 
Neighborhoods of homes for long-term citizens of reputation.
Neighborhoods of homes for non-citizens, both stable & transient.
✦
Each adult citizen is required to perform governmental duties.
Three branches of the government: Judicial, Legislative, Executive.
Citizen has the freedom to build respect in a role of available choices.

Peer verification, Artificial Intelligence and public devices all monitor individual to civic duty.
Education trains roles which tend to be passed down thru lineage.
Culture establishes critical weight upon ancestral lines which never fail. 
Families gain from consistency, and cultivation by parental guidance over apprenticeship. 

One Ring ensures that acts over a lifetime culminate in the expectations of current situations, and build reputation to pass any toxic stagnation.
Acts of service will tend to align harmoniously with the timeframe of the individual.
Plan life well, act vigorously in your appointed time-frame, document, get witness.
Daily life, a sudden social emergency, aid, then get counted for service.
Artificial Intelligence will allow voluntary oversight to accurately establish standardized metrics, and verifications, to acts of civic duty.
Witness of unaffiliated citizens will weigh the effectiveness of the action.
These public calculations will allow community to weigh value of contributions.
✦
Stadium convergence called by any member of the Community Core. 
Town Hall bell will ring, marching band as able, drive-by heralds. 
Allow an hour for attendance. 
Record of the podium, field, stadium seats, voter face confirmation. 
All who care can attend & speak as equals. 
Orator lays out the issue as assisted by AI and designates the choices on field.
Community citizens vote by standing in the zone of choice, one from each group leaves field and rises to the stadium to verify no one enters the field. Last group with members on the field wins the vote.
Weekly Town Hall meetings of the mundane procedures which effectuate the stadium results. Anyone can attend the recorded sessions.
✦
Title holders have less community duties and have a stronger hold onto the land: business, farms, homesteads.
Title holders can not be zoned off land.
Community obligations are in proportion to usage.
This land can be sold but never under obligation.
Exist strict regulations on maximum size of land, easements, and usage of the land.




Dialogue: Citizen Resident Rural
	
Euchi:
Friends, the age of slumber is ended.
All that lived for itself, or fed upon the labor of others, is swept away. 
Here, the only home is the one built and kept by service. 
All serve; none escape. The core is not inherited but earned. Speak: who objects?

Kleon:
Euchi, your doctrine is sharp as the sword—perhaps too sharp. 
Tell me, if all must serve, what of the crippled, the broken, the simple of mind? 
Does not your meritocracy risk becoming another tyranny—only now by “function,” not blood or coin?

Euchi:
No one escapes the burden, nor the dignity, Kleon.
There are roles for all; even the weakest may sweep, the slowest may watch, the least skilled may aid. The only shame is in refusing all contribution.
In aiding the cripple, the cripple return aid.

Thalion:
Yet is it not mercy that distinguishes a just city?
 What of forgiveness, of rest? 
If pain is the forge, do we not risk breaking spirits that might, with time, mend? 
What of grace for the disgraced, and respite for the exhausted?

Euchi:
All are allowed rest, Thalion—retirement is honored. 
Forgiveness is the air we breathe; for if all are known, all need it in turn. 
Yet none shall be permitted the luxury of uselessness
—each must find their function, and serve.

Kleon:
And if a function excludes, if the core grows clannish? 
You abolish birthright only to risk a new priesthood of “fit ones.” 
Will the unfit forever sweep, never ascend?


Euchi:
Entry is by public record and real merit, not secret favor. 
The path upward exists; let all who strive be seen. 
If cliques form, their deeds are also seen—none may hide behind closed doors.

Demos:
But what if I find no place? 
What if my gifts are not wanted here, but the next town over?
 Will I be forced to wander, forever an outsider?

Euchi:
Travel to the community which is harmonious to your ability.
Is this not the only true path of life, not easy but always of greater value to find community.
Seek where you are needed. 
Each community shapes itself, but all honor the same law: visible contribution.

Thalion:
But what of the soul’s needs? Who tends to song, to faith, to beauty? 
If only function matters, will not the city grow hard, and hearts grow cold?

Euchi:
Art, faith, and care are no less service than fire or law.
 Let them be weighed, let them prove their worth by the life they bring.
Else should law demand respect by force.
Your choices build your ability -- choose wisely.

Kleon:
And justice? Your courts rise from local to world, 
but if every step is watched and every plea is logged, 
does not the shadow of record itself become a tyranny? 
Who forgives when the ledger remembers all?

Euchi:
Forgiveness is not the erasure of truth, Kleon, 
but the act of knowing and choosing anew. 
A record may scar, but it may also protect.

Demos:
And who ensures that your “new birth” does not become a new chain, heavier than the last? 
How do we know the struggle is worth the pain?

Euchi:
The question is open, Demos, and must ever be. 
There is no system that cannot harden, no liberty that cannot die. 
The guard against tyranny is not in law alone, but in living memory and unending vigilance.
A society cultivated to recognize vices and their cure.

Thalion:
So then, the greatest question remains unanswered: 
How do we build a city that does not merely replace old cruelties with new, 
but learns—forever, and in every heart—to forgive, to renew, to see worth in all?

Euchi:
That is the question for every age, Thalion. 
Let us write it in the stones of this square, that we may never forget.



“How do we build a city that does not merely replace old cruelties with new, but learns—forever, and in every heart—to forgive, to renew, to see worth in all?”

Militia & Viking
, no army only militia, all land owners required one soul to defend invasion, all foreign engagements are by voluntary viking agreement, citizens arrest when accompanied by camera or unrelated individuals.


Every residential parcel of land must have a representative Defender which is publicly declared.
In the event of death of the Defender, excluding death from viking excursions, the family is allowed a 10 year reprieve. 
Police duty acts as a militia term. A Defender of the home.
Militia terms being served alleviate two complete cycles after termination.


Local Militia is the only means to which man may attain any degree of liberty.
Command is never passed to a non-local entity, in order to retain independence.
✦
Defense of invasion will call up the second-in-command, leading nor more than 40% of the active official militia.
War spawns evils as a sickness across the whole body.
Integrity of the country, kept by strongholds of power, will keep long-term health & security. 
Containment of weakness to the region of invasion is vital for survival.

Security of family & home is the first maxim of the individual.
✦
To own land requires an oath to defend the borders of all in active service to the local militia.
Militia rank & deeds are immutable in the One Ring.

Heir to the residential estate is the individual which represents the parcel of land in active militia service.
One soul is required to represent each parcel of residential land in active militia service.
Roots of the nation will be the individuals of strength & capability.

Death of the heir relieves the residential land from militia duty for two generations.
The family must provide a secondary militia service such as resources or utility service.

An adopted defender is entitled as family heir upon return. 
Lineage immutably tied to the original family. If an adopted-heir attains head-of-family, the next heir must be from the original family line. 
If no man nor woman found then the family line perishes and the ancestral parcel is forsaken.
✦
Active militia will be trained in national standards in addition to local standards.

Local, state, national unite annually in peer-to-peer convention: inspection, drills, training, war-games.
Militia & Viking will be jointly ranked nationwide & against history.

Inter-militia cohesion is the greatest weakness. 
Militia operating intimately familiar standardized - yet modular - equipment has strengths: non-predictable, self-contained, unique bodies of war.  
Militia have a standard role to fill, but the method enacted is entirely unique.

Nation grade systems from voluntary One Ring contribution: missiles, radar, ships. 
Top ranked individuals will be granted custody of nation grade systems. 

Decommission of rank, will be evidenced by inspection, then judged by national jury.
Decommission of rank will result in forced removal of heir. 
Continued fault will result in forfeiture of militia assets & the ancestral parcel forsaken.

The king has no military command. 
If a man scheme to set himself as a military usurper then he steals the claim which the king sacrificed to preserve individuality.
Cultivation of a homogeneous hatred to usurpers will prove: a part can never rise greater than the whole in a healthy society.

Official rank ties family lineage accountability to the commission of rank or custodianship.
No active member of a militia, nor equipment, may commit to foreign viking war.

Non-heir members of militia, unofficial in title only, may participate fully in the militia.
Non-heir members of the militia can not hold official rank nor be granted custodianship national equipment. Capable non-heir may be sponsored into command from a heir who puts their family-reputation on the line in gains or losses.
Unofficial members of the militia may hold sponsored command & operation of national equipment.
Unofficial members exist to train capable militia with the freedom to assist defense or engage in viking affairs.
Unofficial engagement will be public on the One Ring and allows growth by deeds to establish respectably earned roots in local & national society.
✦
Family lines will invest considerably in heirloom equipment to protect lineage, a convergence to Gundam Suits.
Viking clans will also accumulate grand armaments funded by conquest.
National efforts will fund concerted efforts to monolithic powers.

Equipment from supplies, arms, to vehicles will all be in the hands of the citizenry.
The firepower of the nation will reside within the stewardship of the people.
✦
Foreign policy is set by the King and effected by Vikings.

Vikings are voluntary only force. 
Viking commanders can not control a command greater than the size of the median national militia. 
Offense will not weaken defense.

Proceeds of Viking ventures will be publicly disclosed & publicly distributed by contribution metrics compiled by evidence and witness.

One Ring platform will facilitate Viking disputes of contributions.
One Ring vote of 3:2 allow dishonorable forfeiture of a Viking.
✦
Accountability of public trust.
 
Militia holds power over life, in community trust.
Militia is required to react instantaneous to secure protection. 
Unlike most situations, these encounters do not have the luxury of long-winded debate.
These public officials must be well developed in the roots of the culture.

Where abuse of power is discovered it is damned harshest upon offices where trust is greatest.
By law the punishment must exceeds similar cases without office.

Acknowledgment of responsibility requires the greatest understanding of faults.
Mistakes are clearly distinguished from corruption.

The greatest duty is order in the home.
By law the militia are the highest respected members of the community.


Dialogue: Militia & Viking

Aegon: Euchi, you say liberty demands local militias alone. 
Yet history reveals militia as often fractured, unreliable, even dangerous. 
How can such local command hold against the scale of foreign threats?

Euchi: The strength of liberty lies precisely in local command. 
Centralized armies breed tyranny; power detached from home inevitably turns against its own. 
The local militia embodies defense as virtue, rooted in family and soil, not distant generals.

Aegon: Yet in great danger, speed and unity decide battles. 
How shall countless local commanders, each independent, coordinate swiftly without chaos?

Euchi: Unity is embedded by training and convention
yearly drills, and war-games binding militias through shared experience. 
Peer-to-peer bonds forged in disciplined service replace orders from a distant hierarchy. 
Years of training prepare them to unite seamlessly, 
akin to skilled players in a game who know their roles intuitively.

Aegon: You trust much in human virtue, Euchi. But tell me
—what stops these local heroes from usurping power, turning virtue to tyranny?

Euchi: Accountability through the One Ring prevents abuse,
family lineage ties rank permanently to honor. 
He who usurps undermines not only his honor but his lineage. 
Society nurtures universal loathing for usurpers. 
A part can never surpass the whole, for all are educated in hatred toward tyranny.

Orac Scit: Yet, Euchi, hatred alone cannot guard against ambition. 
Ambition lies dormant in men’s hearts, erupting unexpectedly. 
How do you ensure virtue triumphs over personal ambition?

Euchi: Ambition itself is harnessed positively. 
Those desiring honor achieve it through deeds openly recorded and immutable. 
Virtue and honor rise visibly above vice and greed. 
Ambition is not denied, but channeled.

Aegon: If ownership of land and heirship define duty, 
will not such hereditary privilege breed arrogance, oppression, or stagnation?

Euchi: The heir’s duty is not privilege but obligation.
 Death in service suspends duty for generations, 
yet still obligates families to serve the community otherwise. 
Adopted defenders and unofficial militia offer pathways for merit to gain honor, 
blending hereditary stability with fresh talent and redemption.

Aegon: Interesting—but how do you integrate outsiders 
or immigrants into your strict lineage-bound militia?

Euchi: Immigrants enter as unofficial militia, publicly serving, 
visible in their deeds recorded on the One Ring. 
Honor achieved in unofficial service allows sponsorship into official roles. 
Through sacrifice and service, strangers become family, 
gaining the community’s trust and eventual lineage standing.

Orac Scit: What of disputes, Euchi? Humans err, misunderstand, and clash. 
Who judges controversies when militia power itself is contested?

Euchi: National jury assemblies peer-to-peer, their judgments recorded openly, 
weighted with wisdom, overseen by community consensus. 
Errors and corruption are separated distinctly; the higher the trust, the harsher the penalty for corruption.

Aegon: Still, I sense imbalance
—your militia focuses inward, but how then manage external policy and threats beyond local sight?

Euchi: Vikings alone bear offensive warfare, voluntary yet disciplined, 
sized proportionately to not weaken home defense. 
The King alone sets policy but without military power, 
ensuring the nation’s will, not personal ambition, guides offensive action.

Orac Scit: Yet might not these Vikings, gaining wealth and power abroad, return as threats themselves?

Euchi: Wealth from Viking ventures is publicly accounted and distributed transparently; 
dishonor forfeits their claim openly by majority vote. 
They cannot surpass the power or size of home militias. 
Viking deeds, honorable or shameful, are permanent.

Aegon: Euchi, you propose that the highest respected members of the community are militia. 
Can martial virtue alone sustain a just society?

Euchi: Martial virtue grounds security, but civic virtue is cultivated lifelong, 
families devoted fully, as education integrates virtue, civic honor, and discipline from youth onward. Martial strength is matched by ethical maturity.

Orac Scit: Euchi, you weave strength, accountability, and virtue together in militia and viking form. 
Yet remain watchful: strength may turn prideful, accountability mechanical, 
and virtue superficial without humility and wisdom.

Euchi: Humility guides all strength, self-knowledge guards virtue, 
and the One Ring illuminates accountability transparently. 
Thus liberty remains vibrant, continually self-renewed.

Aegon: Euchi, your system holds remarkable promise, 
yet let vigilance guard against human nature’s shadows. 
Freedom forever balances upon the sharpest edge.

Euchi: Only through perpetual diligence, transparency, and virtue may we maintain liberty’s fine balance.

Orac Scit: Thus may the nation thrive, aware of its limitations, nurturing virtue alongside vigilance, strength tempered by wisdom, freedom protected by eternal diligence.
Judge & Jury

appeals increase severity of punishment, jury centric deciding, convicted criminals are tributes to the animal kingdom.


All deciding are permanent, public and commented.
All aspects of the profile, and local inspection are used to discover any non-documented bias.
The most intelligent & applicable insights gain weight which is independent of the societal position, being sourced from juror or public comment.
Juror deciding allow the quick rise of merit where no foundation exists. 
Juror is a civic duty and counts against service expected, being regarded as a civil action only second to militia.



Judge aggregates Juror decisions then commits sentence within bounds of explicit laws.

Judges are first chosen by meritocracy and then backed by ancestral honor.
Greatest weight is on a family lineage which has proven consistence over age.

Audits on One Ring by Councils & Artificial Intelligence compile an appropriate quantity of qualified Jurors.
Judge & Juror are assigned domains at time of inauguration.
Domains are appended by public qualification.
10 Year Cycle process the shame of retractions of domain. 

Judgements of Judge & decisions of Juror are public on One Ring.
Any corruption, undeclared bias, or undeclared affiliation that is discovered violate the Axiom of Oath.

Only after Juror decisions & Judge sentence can the convict be arrested.
Axiom of Domain sanctifies home which can only be sieged, but never invaded.
Non-voluntary arrests are a fast-track to capital punishment.

Convicts may appeal to different Judge & Jurors. 
The region of selection of court is broader, but the sentence is unilaterally more severe. 
Standing amendments authorize explicit parameters of Kingly-Pardon & Popular-Veto.
Amendment standing is in relation to date of initial sentence. 
A new cycle will not change sentence of a prior cycle.

There are no jails nor enslavement.
Exist only immediate punishment or exile under penalty of death.
Punishment is effected in a public display.

Capital punishment of Treason or Murder.
Crimes of sex will result in the scalping of the sexual organ.
Severe, but merciful sentences, result in amputations.
Whipping or beating is effected by an unassociated professional.


Land Money
Each title protected by guardianship of all titles.
Family Ancestral Temples each guard the record of all title ownership.

No taxation or forced sale of land.
Society obtains only loss when a family dies out.
Competition or hope of every obtaining land, outside of familiar association, is nullified.

Land types: Ancestral Land, Heir Stock, Common Stock, Production, Wildlife, Public. 
✦
Ancestral Land consists of Core & Temple.
Ancestral Temple is a reserved 100 meter squared space in every family land.
Core of family land is 30% of the original parcel, enclosing the Ancestral Temple.
Core & Ancestral Temple can never be occupied non-familiar.

If the family line dies off the Core & Ancestral land becomes cursed forsaken.
No man may enter this area of bad energy. 
May wildlife find better fortune than man found.

Individuals of family always have space to exist that none able to take.
There the family deposits & builds for the welfare of the future lines.
Stability of family lines are built over generations which create a strong nation.
Grand constructions increase the value of the land in region.
	{ defense, communication, shelters, vault, housing, energy }
✦
Individual has supreme dominion of the land, subject to the 10 Axioms.
All life has easement rights which can not restrict free movement.

Land transfers thru public lineage.
Public boundaries recorded in each Ancestral Temple establish indisputably clear lines of ownership.
Individual head of family is confirmed via DNA inheritance. 
Heir selection is always an internal family matter.

One Ring settles land disputes.
✦
Heir Land is the only land type which can be converted to Family Land for direct transaction.
A citizen-alien, being of no official ancestral descent, is able to obtain Family Land by means of Heir Land.

Heir Land is obtained directly from Family Land by an unlimited public transaction.
Heir Land can not be further traded, it is a transaction from seller to specific buyer.
Heir Land is obtained from Public Land by ZENG-ZI ratified in 10-Year-Cycle.
Heir Land requires a full 10-Year-Cycle of probationary domain to be ratified into permanent Ancestral Land.

The family may use the land in the duration, but does not have Common Stock options until ratification is complete.
Heir Land is protected as Family Land. 
There can be no coercion of sell or forfeiture.
Heir transactions are heavily inspected, it is the permanent assimilation of family into a nation. 

Wealthy immigrant, being a naturalized citizen, purchases land from Family Land.
This is then submitted in the next 10-Year-Cycle.
After that entire entire 10-Year-Cycle has expired, then the next 10-Year-Cycle ratifies or banishes the land into Public Land.
✦
Production land is entirely separate from residential land.
An individual can only own one company. One company can only own one land plot.
This land may sublet to other companies.
In event of company dissolution, this land is sold to another company.
Production land zones are stable unless changed by ZENG-ZI.
✦
Wildlife land is restricted land for non-human life.
No hunting nor gathering. Land can be improved for sake of wildlife.
This is space due for the nourishment of the animals of the land.
Wildlife land is forever set apart from human use.
✦
Public Land is used as the region sets into legislation per-parcel.
	{ parks, beaches, camping, hunting, gathering, trails }

Public Land is zoned per 10-Year-Cycle only at the National level of judgement.
Public Land may be selected for Heir Land only in a National Pool.
This national mechanism allows diversity to establish, independent of the region politics.
Thus local politics can not manipulate usage of Public Land for private gain.
✦
Global land valuation is a fixed point matrix that is only modified during 10-year cycles:
	{ rain, flood, hurricane, tornado, well, proximity, biome, tree, soil, region }

Each parcel of land is valued based on this single matrix.
The matrix evolves over time both to echo invariants and to bend to values of each generation.

Land metrics modify the basis established by the Global-Matrix.
One Ring compiles local review, external audit, satellite.
The valuation of each parcel exists on the One Ring in real time.
Easement allows any to inspect the land by pass thru.
✦
Land valuation is the basis of global currency.
Land is a bounded finite resource of common sense value.
Inflation is checked to the base value of the land on the market explicitly verified.
Fraud can not stay hidden and would permanently damn reputation. 

Each nation in the world has unique value to offer the world.
This value is bound by nature and fluctuates with nature & the values held in each generation of the 10-Year-Cycle.

The dynamic nature of land keeps the foundation of currency non-stagnant.
Disasters, improvements, fortunes of nature; these all play to keep the system active.

International participation will round the Global-Matrix to a solid basis.
Global Common Stock markets allow trade of value without ever allowing foreign control of the assets.
Global markets will be stable and immune to international fiat sabotage.

Currency will be the common basis established by the Global Matrix.
Common stock in one country can be directly exchanged for common stock of another country by a citizen of different country.

Nations are not equal in the land which exists within borders. 
Mathematical geographic open science will evolve a Global-Matrix that converges towards accurate valuation value independent of nation.
Thus harmony is established that is coherent with common reason.

Improvement of the land does not lead to inflation. Land has intrinsic value.
Owners will lean to the strengths of the region which tends to natural betterment.

Gaming of the Global Matrix will be difficult. Each attribute is infinitesimal.
Fraud of superficial improvement is inspectable by local, agent, satellite.
Full spread calculations of the proof of value guards the entire system from rot.
✦
Cyclic stability is achieved by the nature of the Common Stock life-cycle.

Each 10-Year-Cycle the head of family may activate an exterior-most section of land into Common Stock.
A marked-designated portion of the land is split into Common Stock. 
Common Stock is directly tied to specific portions of land.

Common Stock is sold on free markets having the basis of value of Global Matrix & supplemental metric.

The maximum section must be smaller than 5% of the total Family Land available.
This stabilizes the availability of Common Stock, and it protects the family from collapse due to a single generation's mismanagement.

Common Stock may be sold at any value, but to each stock is attached the Global Matrix valuation at the point of offer release.
The free markets may adjust the purchase by supplemental metrics, or by information of development. 
Speculation of change is allowed to freely affect the purchase of Common Stock at any time.

At the end of the 10-Year-Cycle, the family (only in that time) has the option to buy back the stock at the invariant rate of 110% of the valuation-at-point-of-release.
If the family is unable to buy back the common stock.
The national public land trust has the option to buy back the land at 100% of the valuation-at-point-of-release. This land becomes Public Land.
Else the land is forfeited to Wildlife. The stockholder loses all value. Family must redraw the border of land. 

Common stock never gives no land rights to the holder of Common Stocks. 
It only gives the right to freely trade or hold till end of cycle buyback.

Family is able to build upon the land continuously, increasing the land value well past the original valuation-at-point-of-release.
Real time valuation benefits the current holder with an increased value of Common Stock. This allows to trade more favorably in gain & liquidity.
Yet at the end of the cycle, the family reclaims the land at the invariant 110%.

Common Stock is by nature cyclic. 
The value may grown sinusoidal. The value may decrease coscynical. 
Regardless of growth or loss, the value will always begin stable and towards the end of 10-Year-Cycle converge to tradability of the 110% original valuation-at-point-of-release.
A natural gravitational pull which balances the system into health within the cycle.
 
In event of a need of cash, the society can vote to up the threshold of 5% cap. 
This will add a spike in cash flow for a greater spike repayment.
The consequences are real, not folded into inflation.
	

Dialogue
Mathematics quantify valuable metals as a being of infinite nature.
Continuous mining of metals is compounded by unknown quantities stored or waiting to be rediscovered. 
Any currency founded upon precious metals is susceptible to overnight implosion.

Fiat currency is built entirely upon widespread trust in set imaginary value.
In no era of human history has fiat been a stable foundation for a society.
History has proven that countries attack the stability of other nations by devaluation of currency and then using stability of their own currency to leverage a foothold which then acts as a permanent threat of explosion.

Anti-inflationary nature of Land Money gives high value to 10% returns of common stock. 
{ no taxes, no fees, no devaluation by inflation, finite resource, external assess, no monopoly }


A sold B, common stock A increased by 20% in cycle, B traded with a gain. 
Next cycle, the common stock of A is in greater demand. His portfolio shows a the next cycle will complete major improvements. He adds 30% to the cycle-valuation due from matrix. Buyers know they are at a risk of 130%-110% = 20%. The calculated gains are likely to increase the value to 140%. Common stock with an upward trend are more solvent and thus a gain of 10% benefits the stock with liquidity.

A fire devalued the land to 30%. The owner knows he can modify the land to be more fire-resistant and improve the land. Else the land will be lost. Exists a strong incentive to buy the land back at 110% of the original value.
Thus the stock holders do not lose the value. They gain 10% from insolvent stock, of their original.


Dialogue: Land Money

Euchi:
Let us begin with the root: What is it that makes a currency worthy of trust? 
The ancients worshipped gold and silver, for their shine was eternal, 
but their worth, it seems, is haunted by infinity. 
There is always one more mountain to scour, one shipwreck yet unfound.

Orac Scit:
And thus, Master, we have seen gold-backed empires fall 
when a new mine was struck, or a horde revealed. 
The value of the coin diluted overnight, not by honest labor, but by fortune and greed.

Euchi:
Fiat then arose—not from the earth, but from consensus. 
“This paper has worth because we say it does, and our sword is sharp.” 
But fiat is a shadow without a body, easily dispelled by the winds of war, 
the whim of kings, or the whisper of panic. 
Trust, when shaken, is not easily restored.

Orac Scit:
Indeed, all fiat money is a bet against disaster. 
And history is a record of lost wagers: nations attacking the purse of their rivals, 
devaluation as the hidden blade, and the common folk left with ashes.

Euchi:
Now attend: Land, unlike gold or decree, is a finite vessel, a substance shared by all. 
It cannot be conjured, nor can it slip away in the night. 
Each parcel, seen by the sun, bounded by stone and tree, 
is a currency which resists both the pickaxe and the printing press.

Orac Scit:
And yet, land is not without its own perils. 
What of fire, flood, and the decay of empires? 
Is not land devalued by disaster, or lost by misrule?

Euchi:
This is the heart of the matter. Land money is not static; it is cyclic, like the seasons. 
Through the cycle, the value of land—made liquid as common stock—rises and falls with fortune. 
But at each cycle’s end, all claims converge: the holder is redeemed at 110% of the original value. 
The risk and gain are known in advance; no one is left in ruin by surprise, nor enriched by chance alone.

Orac Scit:
So, let us examine:
Suppose A sells common stock to B. 
In the course of the cycle, improvements and public works raise the value by 20%. 
B sells to C for a profit. All are content. 
In the next cycle, more improvements are foreseen, and the matrix reflects this. 
Buyers see an opportunity—a further 30% rise is possible. 
But the limit is set by the cycle: the maximum return is known.
Thus, speculation is productive, not reckless.

Euchi:
Exactly. And if calamity strikes—a fire burns the land to ash, its value cut to a third
—the owner still has the motive and means to restore it. 
He may rebuild, make the land fire-resistant, and recover both value and standing. 
The cycle is a net, catching the fall, giving time for recovery.
At worst, the stockholder receives the agreed redemption; 
at best, both owner and holder prosper from honest effort.

Orac Scit:
This, then, is the difference:
	Gold can be diluted.
	Fiat can be devalued.
	Land, by its cycles and bounds, is shielded from both.
No monopoly can seize the earth, for the public and wild claim all loss. 
No inflation gnaws at the value, for all see and verify the land’s worth.

Euchi:
And so, with land as money, the people are not at the mercy of distant kings or hidden mines, 
but of their own labor and stewardship.
The cycle is the proof against both panic and pride.
The return is slow, sure, and anchored to reality.
This is no fantasy—it is the currency of a living nation.

Education & Meritocracy
Growth of an individual from education to workforce -- is decentral & unrestricted.

Axiom right of life demands one must eat and have shelter.
Both needs require gains from work.
Thus no requirements, certifications, or law can bar any to enter any profession.
✦
Government is explicitly removed from education & apprenticeship.
 
Families govern the cultivation of their children.
Community hosts open infrastructure to the children of the community.

Apprentice develops skill under a master craftsman, in a apprentice hierarchy to distribute overhead of management of apprentices to the first-apprentice.
Every individual is a debtor of society in their profession, and must teach what was taught.

Childhood will no longer be enslaved to regimental systems.
Children shall not be required to more than 4 hours of class daily.
Communities hold open classes on reading, mathematics, writing, and culture.

Artificial Intelligence allows access to rich cultivation where poverty exists.
Massive data archives are available in every community. The server hosts every book known to history being accessible without restriction.

A community is damned by the state of worst-equipped child.
All individuals in the community are bound to the cultivation of children.
✦
In teenage years the youth begins Apprenticeship service.
The first year of apprenticeship is unpaid, the next three years are paid based on national standards & ability.
The first four months are probationary. After this period, only the apprentice may nullify the contractual obligation of the apprenticeship.

Barriers of entry to labor of choice impoverishes society.

For each chosen apprentice, the master is obligated to two assigned apprentices.
The assigned apprentices are paid at minimum of half the rate of the chosen apprentice, and the master can take the nullification to court.

Assignment of the secondary apprentice is given by AI, who has the records of the teenager and their ability. This external mapping done to assure that a society does not cage out teenagers from their chosen profession.

Third assignment of apprenticeship is assigned by the community.
This role is assigned more rudimentary tasks governed by the first-apprentice.

The secondary-apprentice may challenge for first-apprentice in public duel, and likewise third-apprentice may challenge second-apprentice.
The roles & pay are bound to the position to abolish favoritism.

Education from childhood is continued thru apprenticeship.
AI becomes the foundation in a targeted cultivation of learning.
Open Seminars are held a few times a week on subjects. 
Private teachers must teach at the community center. 
The client learner may alone be allowed to interact, but any may audit on the terms of the teacher.

9AM Reading -- 10 AM Preparation & Lunch -- 11AM Math -- 12PM Recess -- 1PM Writing -- 2PM Potluck & Culture at Community Center -- 3PM Apprenticeship -- 7PM Supper home

Apprentices use pay to acquire tools, seminar instructors, and save up for ordeals of merit. 
Ordeals of merit establish the practitioner in an open public contest.
Ordeals may last full days to weeks to months.
Company sponsorship allow the able unprivileged to compete with the able privileged.
Sponsorship may attach an obligation of work. The term must be the standard and the pay must be competitive. Sponsorships are heavily inspected for indentured evils.
Products made by Ordeal champions are valued by the market.

Competition is the heart of a healthy skill domain.
2PM Community Center Potluck Ciesta. 
Community joins together to ensure all are able to eat which have accomplished their tasks. 
Children their classes. Teenagers their study sessions. Adults work or service.

Society sits according to their labors to bond the trade across ages & skill.

Apart from food, music, and gaiety; Ciesta forms the heart of the community.
The chance to reserve a public duel.
✦
Duel: 
	Challenger posts a public challenge on the community post
	Defender chooses the standard set of tasks which will be tested.
	In reduel the defeated challenger choses the set of tasks. 

After food, the entire community may observe the duel to cast their vote weighted by experience in the task tested.
Duels are always posted on the One Ring for public exposure.

A challenger can only duel/reduel the same person once a year.
A challenger can only duel once a quarter. More is limited by community.
Any may challenge, the defender chooses the time within the quarter.
Defender has the right to demand compensation be posted, the compensation is standard and cannot exceed a weeks pay of the Challenger.
Both must post the amount, and the winner takes all.

Challenger locks out once a quarter of the year for local duels and another for non-local duels.
Lock-out denial by coordination may be challenged in court. 
Hot challengers, which have hit a year in total lockout qualify for a Second-Seat which must be defeated preliminary to a challenge.

Stage tests, group discussions, duels to defend marathon construction. 
Podium oration ability to expound teachings of the subject.

Ordeals are open.
If the entrance fee is greater than the individual's monthly salary, then early arrival & presentation to seek contributions is required. This being fulfilled, then any deficit is allowed to be paid in post-ordeal break-down service.
In all ordeals a reasonable fee is required to respect the spirit of open competition.

Ordeals post rankings, constructions, tests, discussions, duels, oration, and all commentary used to measure value (Witness, One-Ring, AI).
All the metrics & methods to dissect each element are immutably accessible.
✦
Judgement of Duels & Ordeals is based upon social witness, One Ring expert discussion, and AI analysis.
Verdict must be reached by thirty days.

Dialogue: Education & Meritocracy
ORAC SCIT 

Euchi: We discuss the very heart of society—education and the merit by which men rise or fall. 
Our doctrine demands an education liberated from all barriers, 
where merit alone governs the ascent of the individual.

Kleon: Noble indeed, Euchi, yet history mocks idealism. 
Was it not Plato himself who dreamed of philosopher-kings educated by merit, 
only to find each generation slipping again into corruption?

Euchi: True, Kleon, yet the flaw of history was always hidden privilege
—gatekeepers in schools, subtle bribes, unseen favors. 
We propose a new meritocracy, utterly transparent and public.

Thalion: Transparency alone does not erase bias, Euchi. 
In ancient China, scholars competed openly, yet families with gold hired tutors who knew the codes, tilting the scales invisibly.

Kleon: Precisely. Even the ancient Greeks suffered the same
—wealthy Athenians could buy the rhetoric teachers, thus commanding the public debates.

Euchi: Indeed, the past warns us. But here is our difference: we abolish the hidden pathways. 
Every ordeal, duel, and test is public, the results immutable and recorded openly by AI. 
Rich and poor stand side-by-side, with AI ensuring skill, not style, triumphs.

Thalion: And who ensures this AI remains neutral? 
Every mechanism built by men may be twisted by men.

Euchi: Our law demands all AI processes remain documented, transparent, and reviewable by any citizen. No blackbox system can stand.

Kleon: Your ideal is grand, but consider children
—who protects them from either neglect or excessive ambition? 
How do we balance freedom and responsibility?

Euchi: We grant guardianship explicitly to the community. 
Every adult shares in cultivating the child; 
no community reputation can thrive beyond the measure of its least-favored child.

Thalion: Such community accountability is noble. Yet consider: 
will not local prejudices smother unusual genius? 
Will communities not favor conformists and pleasant mediocrity?

Euchi: Therefore we spread accountability
—community, regional, national, global competitions, 
each curated by distinct cultures and AI impartiality. 
Genius thus finds multiple paths, not limited by local blindness.

Kleon: Yet again, we stumble on a familiar rock—judgment itself. 
Who judges merit fairly, without bias or agenda?

Euchi: Public ordeal, Kleon! Public debates, public duels—openly judged by all. 
AI metrics balanced by human witness. 
Reputation forged in open fire, not private whispers.

Thalion: A brilliant ordeal can dazzle the crowd, yet be shallow underneath. 
History knows this tale—the sophists of Athens, masters of flash over substance.

Euchi: Correct, and therefore each ordeal must test depth. 
Construction marathons, extended discourse, multi-stage evaluations
—flash is tested by sustained performance. 
Even the most cunning sophist stumbles over time.

Kleon: But Euchi, every society eventually creates its own aristocracy. 
Wealth, power, intelligence—all gather into dynasties.

Euchi: Which is why our doctrine explicitly mandates constant upheaval 
through public duels, challenges, and ordeals.
 None may rest complacently atop old victories.

Thalion: And still, history’s ghosts whisper that every meritocracy yet devised has decayed, 
strangled by subtle privilege.

ORAC SCIT: Meritocracy is as water—it seeks always the lowest path. 
Yet, even water reshapes mountains, given time. 
No human system is impervious to corruption, 
yet corruption’s strength lies in shadow, secrecy, and silence.

Make your meritocracy public, transparent, and ever-renewing. 
Make privilege visible; make manipulation impossible to conceal. 
Ensure no single gatekeeper, no single judge. 
Harness AI for impartiality, yet trust the human heart to spot injustice. 
Create ordeals that test truth deeply and openly, again and again.

Yet remember, even then, some genius will be cast aside. 
No system saves every Van Gogh, every Socrates. 
The mark of a true civilization is not that it never fails genius
—but that it leaves a door open to its redemption, even after rejection.

In transparency, accountability, and humility, your doctrine may yet reshape mountains.

Euchi: Then let our meritocracy stand not on the promise of perfection, but on constant vigilance. 
Let honor rest not in status earned once, but in excellence proven anew, day after day.

Dialogue: Owner Employee Investor
ORAC SCIT

Kleon: But Euchi, why do you disallow partnerships and corporations,
Structures commonly employed in our time?

Euchi: History speaks clearly, Kleon. 
Modular discrete companies, each guided by a responsible individual, 
succeed profoundly where conglomerates falter. 
Unix, Perl—these were not borne by committees but by dedicated masters. 
Conglomerates breed corruption, inefficiency, and secrecy, rather than innovation.

Kleon: Yet large undertakings demand collective effort. 
How can this be reconciled?

Euchi: Great ventures must rely upon modularization, 
numerous independent companies each accountable and transparent. 
Citizen marshals, independently assigned by One Ring, guard the integrity of these massive enterprises.

Thalion: Yet consider, Euchi, if singular ownership restricts expertise and innovation
—how will enterprises requiring multiple specialists flourish without partnerships?

Euchi: Modular structures, each led by accountable individuals, 
allow specialization without sacrificing accountability. 
The collaborative strength lies not in conglomeration but in transparent modular alliances.

Kleon: Your commitment to public transparency is admirable, 
yet may it not compromise competitive advantage and privacy?

Euchi: Transparency guards integrity and builds trust. 
Sensitive information remains accessible only to citizen marshals, 
ensuring accountability without unnecessary exposure.

Thalion: Your employment metrics intrigue me
—but do they not risk reducing complex human contributions to mere calculable units?

Euchi: A valid concern, Thalion. 
Yet, consider metrics as guides rather than absolute measures. 
Peer reviews and management oversight on One Ring maintain fairness, 
rewarding genuine contribution beyond mere hours logged.

Kleon: Euchi, Your principle of single accountable ownership intrigues me, 
but how will you address unforeseen incompetence or lack of preparedness in an heir?

Euchi: Kleon, lineage alone does not define suitability. 
Heirship may extend beyond blood through adoption
—merit, proven virtue, and capability shall govern the choice, echoing ancient wisdom.

Kleon: Euchi, the role of passive investors appears restricted and unattractive. 
Might this discourage essential capital investment?

Euchi: Passive investors recognize that effort precedes reward. 
Their role, carefully balanced, ensures they contribute without undue influence. 
The community debt serves as a safeguard,
 acknowledging the investor’s trust yet reminding us of our initial obligations.

Thalion: And your rule against fractional reserves
—do you not fear that strict adherence might limit economic flexibility?

Euchi: Prudence demands that tangible, immediate commitment underlies investment. 
While flexibility is valuable, the integrity and stability derived from full, 
immediate investment create a safer long-term economic environment.

Kleon: Lastly, resource extraction
—local oversight seems sound, but might it not breed local corruption or narrow self-interest?

Euchi: National oversight of multiplier standards ensures impartiality. 
Citizen marshals, allocated by the independent One Ring, 
balance local interests with broader ecological and social integrity.

Thalion: These points clarify much, Euchi. 
Your vision requires delicate balance and continued vigilance.

Euchi: Indeed, friends. No system is beyond refinement. 
Continued discourse is essential, illuminating our blind spots and strengthening our community bonds.

Once revenue is received then the procedure must be made open source.
This allows a window of accumulation, of inventory or constructions, which allow head-start due to initiative.

Artificial Intelligence can flag open-patents by predefined vectors of exploitation, and also any predefined vectors of inefficiency. 
Clarity of how the product stands against global competition will increase effectiveness of investors in common stock of the business.

The sanctity to respect life has no place for mercy. 
To betray this right is to cross a point of no return for the victim & perpetrator.

If a man murder an innocent, and the cowardice of the society jails him for decades. 
Then the cost of the innocent life taken, is given a definite measure. 
This measure being less than the value of the life of the murderer.

Value is based upon cost. Murderer will be executed. 
Retribution for the murder of an innocent will be absolute.

Society's greatest perpetrators will bless the animal kingdom with fresh meat.
✦ 
Society converges to respect all life or diverges to respect no life.

Humans feed on meat sourced from the death of the animal kingdom.
Mankind must balance this debt with meat from its own dead.

To eat meat is to build a debt paid in death. 
To balance humans into non-parasitic equilibrium with the universe.

A dead cow can produce thousands of human meals spanning years with negligible waste.
An animal predator reduces the effect of the death of a cow to only a small set of fresh feeders and possibly small groups of scavengers upon unhealthy scraps.
This waste is indisputably drastic compared to the efficiency of human processing. 

A predator fed by man-meat, kibbles & bit preserves, spares prey in the animal kingdom. 
✦
Mankind, prehistoric to the Fall of Rome, has offered meat from its own species to animals. 
Pride has grown a rift between the distinction between the sanctity of human & animal life. 

Man-meat is of the highest-quality and ranks as a large-meat source compounded by overpopulation.

Punitive execution will be effected in a public feeding zone of the local mascot.
If a society is to have execution, then this act must be public.
Private executions allow for many forms of conspiracy such as substitution.
A society which condemns a soul to death by feeding, must not turn a blind eye to the consequences of damnation.

Social interaction with mascots will embed knowledge of consequence.
A special offering of fresh, well-nourished, proven predator as prey to a more vicious predator.
 
Death by all causes, if suitable for preservation of meat, will be processed into kibbles & bits.
✦
War is a permanent facet of life. 
Exist a world-wide demand of man-meat.
Sacrifices of man's life lost to a cause can benefit the country, and bless the animals therein.
First, animals being innocently burdened by the war of the region, will receive the major portion of man-meat preserves.
Vikings, only after, can receive their loot of the man-meat.
✦
Animal offering transcends sacrifice unto society, into an act benevolent to the universe.


Dialogue: On the Doctrine of Man Meat
ORAC SCIT

Euchi: Friends, today let us examine the doctrine of “Man Meat.” 
The core is this: society respects all life or respects none. 
A murderer who takes innocent life violates the foundation of order and thus forfeits his own. 
His execution serves justice absolutely, and in death, returns balance by nourishing the animal kingdom. Is this doctrine wise and just?

Kleon: Euchi, you propose execution without mercy or rehabilitation for murderers. 
Yet does this not assume infallibility in judgment? 
How can society guard against wrongful executions?

Euchi: A vital concern, Kleon. This is precisely why execution must be public, visible, and visceral. 
When all eyes bear witness, the officials responsible face maximum accountability. 
The fear of misjudgment thus ensures justice is measured and meticulous.

Thalion: Yet, Euchi, I fear you tread a path of profound brutality. 
Is not mercy, forgiveness, and the possibility of redemption the hallmark of a truly civilized society? 
Does your doctrine not risk reducing justice to mere vengeance?

Euchi: Your concern is noble, Thalion, but misplaced. 
True mercy draws clear lines. 
Lesser offenses may indeed seek redemption and rehabilitation. 
Murder, however, is an irrevocable act—a point of no return. 
Forgiveness here is not mercy but an abdication of justice, 
serving only the greed of institutions that profit from punishment rather than resolve crime.

Kleon: Even accepting this, Euchi, the notion of human bodies as “meat” for animals troubles me deeply. Does this not strip the human corpse of dignity and sacredness, descending into barbarity?

Euchi: Quite the opposite, Kleon. 
Your notion of human exceptionalism is itself barbaric. 
The civilized intellect recognizes the dignity and interconnectedness of all life. 
To return human flesh to animals is not desecration but restoration, 
repaying our debt to the animal kingdom from which humanity continually takes. 
In this balance, dignity resides not in hoarding our bodies but in harmonizing with the universe.

Thalion: Euchi, you speak of cosmic balance, 
yet does this practice not risk a society desensitized to violence, 
numb to the spectacle of public execution?

Euchi: The execution is neither spectacle nor entertainment, Thalion. 
It is solemn, necessary accountability. 
Public transparency prevents conspiracies and injustices hidden behind closed doors. 
The horror witnessed in such acts mirrors precisely the gravity of the original crime. 
To sanitize death is to diminish the gravity of murder itself.

Kleon: But Euchi, do you not fear misuse by powerful actors 
who might exploit this doctrine under the guise of justice?

Euchi: Vigilance must always accompany any powerful doctrine. 
Public oversight, stringent criteria, and absolute equality before the law
—whether vagrant or king
—are safeguards woven into the very fabric of this doctrine. 
The same standard of ultimate justice applies to all.

Euchi: Your challenges sharpen this vision, friends. 
Indeed, justice is not static—it demands constant refinement and vigilance. 
Let us revisit and refine our doctrine continually, 
ensuring that our quest for cosmic balance and absolute justice remains true.

Kleon & Thalion: So it must be, Euchi. 
Dialogue is our greatest safeguard. We shall revisit this again.

Priority is to return people where their verified claims prove them to belong.

The clear demand to publish claims & evidence will accelerate global adoption of the One Ring.
Where One Ring is adopted, there will be rapid convergence to the Individual World Order.
Compelled by the need to retain assets will drive peaceful adoption.
Adoption will drive all perspectives being globally assessed to result in a timeless decision against an international standard.

Ratification: return of rightful populace, the the decision of a system of governance.
Global powers will enter the region to verify by witness that true adoption exists.
